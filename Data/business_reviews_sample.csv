I finally came last weekend for dinner with a friend and immediately noticed a festive vibe walking in. There is a bar to your left as you step through a narrow path to the back where the restaurant opens up for full table seating. Behind the bar as you walk up a half flight of steps, you get a full view of the open kitchen on your left (I'm a big fan of open kitchen models).

Since the weather was pleasant, my buddy and I opted to sit outside on the back patio, where there are maybe 10 tables. By the time we left, all of them were full.

We both ordered a Mexican Old Fashioned cocktail to start (made with Mexican bitters). Good stuff. I later had a margarita on the rocks which was decent, but not spectacular.

We shared an order of (slightly spicy) guacamole and then I ordered the flank steak entree, served with creamed spinach with bone marrow and chimichurri. Excellent. Our sever even brought corn tortillas and white rice so that I could construct a couple of fajitas.

We ate lunch there last Saturday. The restaurant was almost empty save for two other couples. We were greeted and seated immediately. Once I looked at the menu, I realized that it was not the same one as is posted online. This is the second time this has happened. How is it that some restaurants can list daily specials online and Valanni can't keep their regular menu up to date?

Our seeimingly bored waiter took our orders and then spent must of his time hunched over the bar checking messages or texting someone on his phone. 

After our food arrived he returned and announced that he would check up on us in a few minutes to see how are meals were. Good thing he never got around to it. Our kobe beef burger, ordered medium rare, was cooked well beyond well done and my grilled cheese panini was so overdone that the black marks from the grill were indistinguishable from the rest of the bread. Blackened grilled cheese anyone? At least the french fries weren't overdone but were salty as hell. Maybe the cook was too busy texting our waiter?

After we finished eating what we ate of our meals, a clumsy bus boy appears. While clearing a few plates he almost dropped one of them so he decided to make two trips. Didn't help because on the second visit he dumped a french fry on my jacket on the seat next to me and didn't apologize or bother to pick it up off the floor where it wound up. 

Then the waiter reappears. I guess his texting or whatever was done. He presented us with the check. Never asked us how our meal was or if we wanted dessert (charred oreo beignets anyone?).",2012-11-19 13:45:59,Valanni,1229 Spruce St,Philadelphia,PA,19107,39.9467941,-75.1622221,4.0,875.0,0.0,"{'BikeParking': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'BYOBCorkage': ""'no'"", 'Caters': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'HasTV': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""'full_bar'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': True, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'Music': ""{'dj': None, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}""}","American (New), Nightlife, Greek, Cocktail Bars, Bars, Mediterranean, Restaurants, Pizza, Tapas Bars, Latin American, Tapas/Small Plates, Lounges","{'Monday': '16:30-0:0', 'Tuesday': '16:30-0:0', 'Wednesday': '16:30-0:0', 'Thursday': '16:30-0:0', 'Friday': '16:30-2:0', 'Saturday': '16:30-2:0', 'Sunday': '10:0-0:0'}"

I left the neighborhood for Rittenhouse for a couple of years and have just recently returned to my old Washington Square West stomping grounds.  I couldn't be happier to now call this place one of my top neighborhood go-to's!  

The staff is so friendly and always remember my familiar face; the servers are always quick to honor my recommendations request (and they answer HONESTLY without mentally adding up the tip amount by suggesting the priciest items); and while both the downstairs and upstairs bars are a great social scene, the downstairs square bar layout is designed in such a way that it's easy becoming fast friends with the crowd around you while taking in a sports game and sipping Margaritas.  

While Mixto is far from a ""hidden gem"" and overall a well known Philadelphia eatery, the amount of seating available is vast, therefore leaving it a safe bet to snag a spot quickly for Sunday brunch or an impromptu Saturday night date.  While you might not be able to locate a table, there's always room at the bar, which is set up to make eating a meal there less of a last resort and more of a preference.  

As far as outdoor dining goes, while there are only a handful of sidewalk seats, this place opens up their floor to ceiling windows in the warmer months, making the downstairs seating feel as close to an outside eating experience as it can get while staying inside.  

And now, for the finale slash best kept secret, drum roll please...

While recently dining here with a friend from Spain, I was introduced to the beef empanadas.  They are hand made daily and, according to him, the best he's ever had outside of Spain itself.  You can order them in twos, along with the chicken empanadas, and they serve as an amazing beginner dish to get the taste buds talking.  I have become accustomed to fulfilling my addiction for them by calling for takeout on my way home from work. They may just be one of the most reasonably priced ways to treat yo'self on the run.  I encourage you to partake!  

Keep up the good work, Mixto.  You're one of my favorite things about choosing Wash Sq.

Unfortunately, Cafe La Maude doesn't measure up to similar nearby restaurants. I had high hopes because I've heard people talking about this place and the Yelp reviews were great. I've been here a couple times and I have been underwhelmed on both visits. The first time I visited, 3 of us came on a Friday morning for brunch and had to wait around 20-30 minutes, which was particularly annoying because there were a few tables that had not been cleaned after guests had left.

They had both inside and outside seating. A table outside opened up first, so that's where we chose to sit. Outside seating is on a slanted sidewalk, which was very uncomfortable. During my second visit I sat inside, which felt tight and small, but it felt a lot nicer than sitting on a tilted, wobbly table. 

Because of the wait, I had plenty of time to look at the menu and read reviews. What surprised me was the prices, as this place is notably more expensive than similar restaurants.

I ordered the grilled chicken panini, which came with goat cheese and spinach. It was very delicious. I believe the bread was ciabatta, which I am a huge fan of. 

I can't see myself eating here on a regular basis considering the price. $14 for a small panini and five waffle fries isn't completely practical.",2011-07-16 01:12:15,Max Brenner - Philadelphia,1500 Walnut St,Philadelphia,PA,19102,39.9491000076,-75.1661748827,3.5,1358.0,1.0,"{'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'WiFi': ""'free'"", 'Caters': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': True, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}""}","American (Traditional), Restaurants, Desserts, Food, Chocolatiers & Shops, American (New), Specialty Food, Breakfast & Brunch","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Wednesday': '16:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-22:0', 'Friday': '14:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '10:0-23:0', 'Sunday': '10:0-21:0'}"

The best thing on the regular menu in my opinion are the mahi mahi tacos, which never disappoint.  The first time I went here, the server suggested that I add the pineapple salsa, which I did and it went with the well seasoned fish.  I also like to add cheese and jalapenos.  Also the yuca fries are crazy good.  I usually can't eat those and the tacos together because it's too much food for me alone, so we get one order and share.  The veggie quesadilla is really good, especially if you like mushrooms.  My boyfriend enjoys the giant burger here.  The specials are fresh and interesting and I had lovely veggie root tacos here a few weeks ago.  The texture and the seasonings were really nice.

If I have any real critique here it's how they handle the happy hour. I hate the practice of only offering happy hour prices at the bar, something I rarely encounter outside of Philly. When your in such a small space already, paying full price while somebody sitting on a stool within arms reach pays less just rubs me the wrong way.

This neighborhood gem, satisfied your craving for both the sweet and the savory.  It unifies those friends and couples who just happen to have two very different tastes in brunch and lunch, or simply, just can't decide.  

I like the simplicity of the choice.  There are three main options on the menu.  There is the fried chicken sandwich, which is a fairly recent addition to the menu after proving a hit at the Spruce Street Harbor booth.  The sandwich is my personal menu favorite.  I love the savory fried chicken, the sweet buttermilk ranch, and the crunchy and tangy pickle all combined in a perfect bite (after bite).  The fried chicken, comes in a 3 piece or 6 piece and can be served dry, in a wet glaze and one of three dry rubs.  Finally, the donuts make for a delicious sweet ending.

While the cocktails were underwhelming, the food was completely...WOW (even didn't have the chance to document it, it was so good). 
The Parker house rolls - don't skimp out on these. They're so worth it (6 to a skillet). And the chive butter - so good. 
The Seafood cioppino was large with a flavorful red broth and good quantity of seafood. 
The Honey brined pork chop was massive; nothing over the top but great dish. 
The Plant power bowl is large and in charge. For a vegetarian dish, they crushed this with a flavorful peanut curry-ish sauce. Well done. 
The Thai salmon was probably the most surprising dish. Salmon nowadays is, well, boring. In a thick curry broth, this sizable portion of salmon was well flavored and topped on the perfect amount of crisp and crunchy vegetables. It packed a sneaky heat which was a great touch m

So yeah, we were *those* people that got the Boot. I mean, we had friends from out of town, we wandered into BRU, and we felt like it would be a great story. It was quite a bit of cash (around $45 including the beer), but we got an absolute delicious Hefeweizen that really hit the spot (always ask the waitresses for recommendations). It's a lot of beer, even for the four of us, but definitely a fun thing to do with friends and you get to keep the boot afterwards.

The place is small. When I arrived with two of my friends, there were two seats available at the bar together, and another seat open separated by an individual who graciously moved down for my party. We managed to grab his seat upon his departure, for another friend. We were lucky that we got there when we did as the place became full of patrons waiting to get a seat. What this place lacks in size it makes up in every other aspect including the service and spirits at the bar, and the grub coming out of the kitchen. 

The bartenders were not there to just pour drinks. Whether it was the warm-up beers we ordered, to the glasses of whisky later, they provided a brief explanation of everything my compadres and I were considering. The bar is small, but I guess the upside of that is that the bartenders are more attentive. I never had to wait for drink. My bartenders were there to wait on me the minute I took my last sip. I can't remember their names, but they were two bartenders that worked last Friday (4/24/15) between 5-8pm. 

In regards to the grub coming out of the kitchen, let me start with the shrimp. The popcorn shrimp was crispy and seasoned a little more than the usual popcorn shrimp appetizers. After two glasses of Whisky, I broke down and ordered the Whisky King. I never imaged myself eating a burger with Foie gras on it, but I did, and I would probably do it again. In addition, the Applewood bacon, blue cheese, and the maple bourbon glazed cipollini onions, only enhanced the creation of flavors taking place between the buns. Despite the fancy presentation, the burger did not lose its simplicity, which is the flavor of the meat. There was only one way to close the show after this burger. That is right, an another glass of whiskey. Make it a 12 year please. 

An abundance of aged libations, creative burgers, and professional staff are the attributes that make Village Whiskey.",2015-04-30 16:13:22,Village Whiskey,118 S 20th St,Philadelphia,PA,19103,39.9514165949,-75.1737677917,4.0,1553.0,1.0,"{'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'CoatCheck': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{u'breakfast': False, u'brunch': False, u'lunch': None, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': None, u'dessert': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'DriveThru': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': True, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': True, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}"", 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False'}","Bars, Nightlife, Whiskey Bars, Burgers, Restaurants, American (New)","{'Wednesday': '16:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-21:0', 'Friday': '16:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-21:0'}"

I am such a fan of the ladies of 13th Street, so I had to give this a try.

The waitress was super informative: she gave some recommendations, but pretty much explained the whole menu. This was good because it has only been 2 weeks since the place opened (thus not enough Yelp reviews for suggestions).

The decor is awesome, kind-of a Gothic appearance with a cool wall mural, black chandeliers, and wooden tables.

I tried the Warm Medjool Dates, Pig's Tail A La Plancha, Calamares Negras, and Setas A La Plancha.  The winner was definitely the pig's tail, followed by the dates. I would say the calamares were my least favorite, partly because I felt like a good 1/3 of the plate was just fried bits of ink without the calamari in it (unless my friends ate them while I wasn't looking..highly likely). I also thought it was a little salty. The mushrooms in the Setas were very flavorful, and the foie gras wasn't bad either, but I'm not a big fan of foie gras in general. For dessert, we tried the Bunuelos, and they were money, like more money then FedNuts.

No question this place is rustic Northern Italian from floor to ceiling & certainly including the food on the table in between the two.  I found the decor to be warm & homey if only a little industrial.  The chairs could be a little more comfortable to be sure, but that is certainly my biggest complaint about Osteria & I'll gladly sit on those hard wooden chairs again if it means I'll be filling up on more of Vetri's creations.

The menu is full of interesting combinations of food, many of which sound quite bold & possibly hard to pair following dishes with, but that was not so, at least in my case.  I found each item delicious in its own unique ways & in no way did it play upon my opinion of following dishes.  I started with mozzarella in carrozza with olive oil, poached pear tomatoes and capers.  Incredible!  Really, it was like a large bit of fried mozzarella, but certainly the most delicious fried mozzarella that has ever graced my mouth.  It was incredibly gooey & the pear tomatoes were perfect along with it.  For my primi I went with the robiola francobolli with chanterelle mushrooms and thyme which I think were my favorite dish of the evening.  The sauce was rich & the ""post-stamp"" ravioli absolutely delectable.  I could have easily eaten a far larger dish of these delicious little bites.  For the secondi I tried the rabbit ""casalinga"" with pancetta, sage, brown butter and soft polenta.  Now this was my first time with rabbit, so I can't compare it to anything I've had before.  I will say that I was pleasantly surprised (not that I was expecting to not like it, but I was expecting it to be gamier).  The way in which it had been prepared...it was half a rabbit, bone in, glazed & seared if I remember correctly...was mouth watering.  The meat was full of flavor (altho somewhat ""chickenish"" to me) & tender.  I even enjoyed the dark meat & I generally do not like dark meat of ANY sort!  For the contorni I tried the artichokes alla romana which were also very good.
Boyfriend tried the lobster & pasta special for his secondi which was also amazing, of course.  A whole lobster which had been shelled served with spaghetti in a red sauce which had a slightly cajun taste to me.  Not what we were expecting, but still nothing short of luscious, of course.
Finally for dolci I had something much like a crepe, which had been glazed & then topped with a streusel.  Good, but not as sweet as I was expecting (hoping?).  Also, it was VERY hot.  It took quite some time for it to cool down to a point where it was comfortable to eat.  

Service at Osteria was very good.  Our server was very helpful with any questions we had regarding the menu, nor was he overbearing.
The wine list is fairly extensive, but a bit pricey, namely if you're just buying by the glass.  While deciding on which red to go with I was even offered generous samples of a few of the reds to help me along with my decision.

I'm tempted to give Osteria only 4 stars for some reason, but my complaints are really so few & I was so very, very happy with the food & service & place in general that I think its more fair to just go with 5.  (Once again, I find myself wishing Yelp could give half stars!)

""No, I don't think I'd come here on a first date.""

See, I don't do burgers terribly often. So many folks just don't get it right. The meat's overworked, the patty to bun ratio is off-kilter, the toppings feel like an afterthought. But, on those rare occasions that I hear from multiple individuals (friends, family, and strangers alike) that Village Whiskey offers ""The best burger of their lives"".... well, when in Rome. A Monday evening with the little sister in town, we were still told there was a 30-45 minute wait. Then, we realized the bar had about 6 seats just waiting and, as it was full service, we promptly snagged our stools. 

No time for appetizers, and missy was not of age to partake in spirits, we were mostly just eyes on the prize. Meat. And lots of it. We each ordered a Village Burger with cheddar and, while she opted for the smoked bacon, I followed the wise words of Mike B. and ""put an egg on it."" We split some of those duck fat fries and, since Drake's explained to all of us that you only live once, splurged with the Sly Fox cheese sauce. Neither of us were disappointed.

The wait was not long, the lighting warm and inviting, and the bartenders friendly (though, perhaps since we were only ordering sodas, nothing exceptional. I'm sure if we were in the market for some whiskey, that might be different). Upon the arrival of our burgers, we momentarily marveled at the height of the patties, wondering how on earth we would smash them down to a palatable size. Choosing the rip-and-chomp method, we divided and conquered our burgers, piece by glorious, meaty piece. Each topping was exceptionally done, from the Boston Bibb lettuce to the ripe, juicy tomato. Really, juicy is the word that comes to mind for this entire meal. It's the kind of meal that makes you wish your napkin came with two other napkins, the kind of juicy that results in finger-licking and bun-dipping. Unfortunately, unlike some reviewers, my egg wasn't particularly runny, but I'm sure that could be resolved with a simple request, and honestly.... I don't know if I needed much more dripping down my hands.

For the two of us, including two sodas, the bill ran a cool $50, but I firmly believe it was worth it for an indulgent evening with the baby sister.

For starters, I love the bazooka limon guac, or the macho nachos with pulled chicken rather than beef or chorizo. Do yourself a favor and share these!! They're gigantic haha, but best nachos of my life! No joke.

For my meal, my true loves are the carnitas tacos (my bf loves the mahi tacos) and the chicken enchiladas, or if I'm sharing with a bunch of friends we usually do the Tacos al Carbon....now the menu says it's for 2, but if you're getting appetizers like the guac, this can certainly be enough for 4 people! It comes with enough toppings for an army too...it's amazing. 

As far as the drinks go, they're known for their blood orange frozen margarita, which is my personal fave. They have a huge list of tequilas though, as well as various margaritas and sangria! Plenty to choose from, and they have pitchers of many of their drinks as well!

Things can get pricey if you're there for dinner and drinks, but you can plan to avoid that as well by sharing because the portions are huge.

Ordered rouge burger, truffle fries, and seasonal pumpkin gnocchi. The burger was cooked medium rare as requested but fell apart instantly as the buns absorbed the juice. The pattie  was really thick and juicy yet somehow the burger still ended up being dry. 

We ordered truffle fries but were given plain fries. They were replaced and on the house. The truffle fries weren't any different though. I found the fries over cooked and dry. Truffle flakes didn't make them any better. 

Gnocchi was a small but heavy dish. Full of flavor but way too much flavor. Needed something simple and clean to pair with it. Has a hint of Asian cuisine flavors.

Everyone we knew was raving about Morimoto so we knew we had to check it out. We never spend much unless it's a special occasion so we were expecting more bang for our buck coming here. Overall, for the portion size and price tag and flavors, none of it was worth it. There will be a break down of what we had. Mind you, maybe I just don't have a palette for the fine dining side of food, but a lot of street foods I've had in other cities and countries was so much better and at a quarter of the price!

Service was great, I will hand them that. Our server was around just enough to get orders and clean our tables, not overbearing. Although, they kept switching our plates and I kept thinking what a waste of water and time, I only had one food item on that dish, I can use it for the entire meal.

- Pork belly and porridge - it was tender and fall apart in your mouth, the porridge had a hint of seafood (potentially coming from the Thai sauce since they used that in most everything) the porridge was salty but the pork was perfect, could've been bigger

- Tempura - this was the best appetizer and there were all sorts of goodies, from carrots to shrimp to ham/bacon and cheese, to mushrooms. Each bite was different and it was fun trying to figure out what was what. The sauces were good too, favorite was the cheese sauce, next the sirarcha, and last was that Thai sauce 

- Lychee and fig drink - my favorite drink out of the 3, fresh, clean, not too sweet, and there was a lychee in it to clean the palette, good balance of flavors

- Morimoto martini - I took a sip, it just tasted like alcohol to me, my husband enjoyed it. I am by no means an alcohol connoisseur 

- Chiyu drink - same as above, even more alcoholic tasting. I always thought these drinks were suppose to either mask or blend the flavors better, but again not my area of expertise. I'll stick with the food.

- King crab - fresh, tiny portion for the price. But delicious dips. I can't remember the dips but it was nice to be able to go back and forth between them

- Morimoto ramen - by far the worst dish we had. Salty beyond belief. The portion size was a joke. And to call it ""iron chef,"" was embarrassing. No substance at all. Literally just boiled bones and salted it and threw some noodles and chicken in it. This was so disappointing and an embarrassment to ramen. They should have not called this a ramen or just take it off the menu. To charge what they did for a tiny bowl is absurd. Again maybe I'm not meant for fine dining.

- 12 oz Australian wagyu steak - cooked the way we asked, the sauce was delicious, but again overly salted. Or maybe Americans are just eating this salty nowadays?!

3 pieces of sushi - nothing amazing about it. It just tasted like any sushi I've ever had anywhere. Not impressed.

Overall, this place is completely overrated and the price is not worth the experience. Not to mention, they have on each table the most interesting light fixture. I mean, usually you would want to keep your intimates hidden if you get my drift. (Pic attached) we will not be back. The only other fine dining experience we had was at Gordon Ramsey's steak house in Vegas and we spent a little bit more than we did here. Completely different experience, perfection food at Ramsey's so it was disappointing. I just want all the folks coming here for the hype, to beware.

It was obviously busy but we were still seated pretty quickly. It's a very simple  modern open decor  which I liked. I was really excited to order the dan Dan noodles.

They bring the noodles to you and mix them which is a nice gesture. And the portions were huge. 

My only random critique is that their plates are too small?? They have these small rectangular plates that are really cute and functional for an appetizer, but not so much for dinner. I kept making a mess on my side of the table because my noodles kept dropping from the serving bowl to my plate!

Being my first time at this place, I took a while to look through the menu and during that time our waiter checked up on us like 4 times. They're a little too efficient. 

I had the chance to try three dishes here, mainly recommended by fellow yelpers: the Roti Canai, Hainanese chicken and beef satay. The Roti Canai came with this flatbread that has similar texture to Dosa. It's real thin and has a crisp to it. The side of coconut curry was delicious and really complemented the flatbread. The Hainanese chicken was pretty simple, just steamed chicken in light soy sauce. The flavors worked well together and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The side of rice that came with this dish was delicious as well. It's not your regular rice. It's nicely seasoned and has a yellowish tint to it. I could probably just eat the rice by itself. The beef satay had a sweetness to it and the side of peanut dipping sauce added an extra layer of sweetness as well. I wish the satay was a tad more savory than sweet.

I got a lot of answers and Kraftwork was among those mentioned; however, it slid to the back of my mind and I sorta forgot about Kraftwork for a while. Fast forward about a year and I find myself here. 

We had attended the Philly Beer Expo at the Naval Yard earlier in the day and met up with a friend who lived in Fishtown. She was nice and sober enough to drive us back to her place where we sobered up. We asked her if we could grab a bite to eat before heading back to Jersey and she suggested Kraftwork. ""Oh I've heard of them!"" I said, but I couldn't drum up where or when I had heard of them. 

We get to the bar, I open the menu, and then it hits me when I look at the list of burgers. ""I heard that the burgers were good here"" I drunkly thought to myself (or maybe I said it out loud, I can't quite say). I opted for the Kraftwork burger with cheddar (I think) and bacon red onion marmalade (that's right bacon red onion marmalade). Just typing it now has me drooling again, so you can only imagine my enthusiasm for this condiment. 

Needless to say the burger was cooked just right and the bacon red onion marmalade was absolutely delicious. Come to think of it, even if the burger was bad, I don't think I would've noticed because I was still in post-beer fest awe at the deliciousness of this creation. I did not order a beer, but word on the street is that they have a pretty nifty tap selection, so I will be sure to return for that.

I came here over the weekend, and clearly many others are in the same boat. It was packed but the line moved quickly. On top of that, our food arrived quickly and seating was still ample since the restaurant space is surprisingly large. 

As for what we actually ate there, we split:

+ Hummus w/ slow-roasted lamb - The meat & toppings mix was kind of funky and gamey tasting for some reason. Not as big of a fan as I am for Dizengoff's hummus & toppings. Suraya's hummus is also more neutral-tasting.

+ Shish taouk sandwich - stuffed with chicken, french fries, and some other stuff. Not bad, but wasn't super impressed compared to other Middle Eastern fare I've had in Philly.

+ Turmeric tea - very nice and liked the spices

The baked goods counter looked incredible, and I wanted to just sample a little of everything. In fact, I came close it and got a huge bag of pastries to go:

+ Cruller - one of the best I've had!
+ Flan patissier - this had Meyer lemon in it. Wasn't a huge fan, and comparable to other egg tarts I've had
+ Jalousie - not bad. Not as buttery or flavorful as I'd hoped
+ Chocolate pistachio (financier?) - same as above.

Again, I love the concept, the incredible design of the interior, etc. However when it came down to the food, I wasn't super impressed.

I've given Vietnamese food a try several times, and it's always against my better judgement.  Since the day I got duped into going for Pho, only to find out that there's no such thing as vegetarian Pho, to the day that I went to Vietnam Palace for a friend's birthday, was given the wrong order (which had meat in it), and was overcharged... I feel like it's just not meant to be.

So when my boyfriend asked if I wanted to go for Vietnamese last week, I kindly declined.  It's not that I don't like the food, I just don't love it.  I'm just a vegetarian-Chinese addict that eating anything else (anything at all!) seems silly.  But given my past experiences, I never really had a desire for Vietnamese. He wanted it, though, so I gave in.  And whaddaya know... they gave me the wrong food, and by the time I got the food I ordered, my friends were already done eating.

We arrived 15 minutes late for our reservation but fortunately it wasn't a problem.  The service was good and the waiter reminded me of Alton Brown somewhat in appearance and demeanor (not a bad thing).  And I actually like that he didn't refill our wine glasses after the initial filling.  I know some of you like waiters to do that but I think waiters at BYOs don't have any idea about how the wine is being distributed at the table and sometimes people drink faster and really shouldn't have their glasses automatically refilled because then they're getting a disproportionate share of the bottle.  Here I go off on a tangent again.  I am a wine Marxist.

We ordered appetizers of a certain kind of Amazonian fish (I guess the Greeks can cook fish from anywhere) and the trio of dips.  The dips were excellent, especially the garlic one.  A sizeable morsel of said dip remained on the plate and then a waiter whisked it away before I could tell him that me doth protest.  Those waiters are awfully quick to take your plates and ask you if they can take it *while taking it away*.  Hold on to your horses, boys.  I also almost lost my last bite of my entree this way but I was quicker on the draw that time.

It wasn't till nearly the end of our dip feast that the waiter informed us that the fish appetizer had been sold out.  So that's fine, but why it took him that long to realize I'm not sure.  We ordered the octopus ragout in its place, which arrived promptly and was very pleasing.  The octopus was tender (for octopus) and all the flavors came together harmoniously.  I loved the little bits of chorizo-like sausage in it, whatever they were.

I had the goat entree, which was steaming hot upon its arrival but fortunately cooled off quickly.  The portion size was decent and the meat was amply tender.  Combined with barley, greek yogurt, breaded eggplant, etc. it was a nice homey dish.  I sampled my sister's quail, constituting my first bite ever of this fowl.  Lacking other quail experience I can't comment too much on it but the meat seemed to be cooked well.  The sauce for this dish was pretty heavy on the sherry.  My sister seemed to like this aspect; I would have been more on the fence about it.  Every course of the evening was seasoned well. ++

I don't know if I'd rush back here but would recommend it without much hesitation to anyone looking for Greek.  I'd like to give it four and a half stars.  WHY can't Yelp have a half star option?

Once we were seated, the service was good and the waitress helpful with the menu. The pizza was fantastic! Perfectly done.

We were seating pretty quickly and ordered some beers- the selection they have is great. I can understand why it gets so much hype.

Our server was so knowledgeable about each beer and made recommendations based on what we told him. He was also able to point out different things on the menu that were vegan for my friend and what he would recommend. 

Now for the food- I do not understand all the raving about their mussels- I have tried far better in many other local establishments (White Dog Cafe, Twenty Manning just to name a few) as I always seem to order them whenever I go out to dinner. If you are looking for a variety of types of mussels, then Monk's has far more than the usual White Broth or Red Broth variety. Were they good? Yes. Best in the city- absolutely not.

I'm sure the menu has changed since so talking about what I had, which I can't remember anyway, is probably a moot point.  However I want to relay an anecdote of our experience which should give you an idea of the lengths Zahav will go to satisfy you.

I went to dinner here while still dating my girlfriend whom I've since married and we had a fantastic meal.  All the courses were packed with flavor and we could not have been happier but for one thing.  We were still just a little hungry:-)  Our dinner was at 10PM so we were both pretty hungry when we started.  I know I know, this isn't the type of place you'd stuff your face but we wanted to get a little more.  

We asked the server to bring us a menu and ordered a portion of the fish course a la carte.  The fish course was brought to us quickly and as was with the rest of our dinner, fantastic, no surprise there.  The surprise came when we got the bill.  The server must have overheard our conversation about being still hungry and the manager had taken the fish course off our bill.  Mind you we didn't ask for them to do this but I was absolutely delighted that they would do something like this.  Suffice to say I have been singing their praises ever since.  

To me having small portions can sometimes feel like you didn't get your money's worth but in this case, the food, the level of dedication of the staff will make this an experience you will not soon forget.

Definitely my favorite place to get a quick healthy meal in manayunk.  All the wrap menu items can be made as salads, or you can do my favorite, the make-your-own salad.  The ingredients are tiered by price, so it can get a little expensive for a salad if you get a lot of them, but it's well worth it.  The have some of my favorite salad toppings including artichokes, kalamata olives, and gorgonzola (though I am sad they got rid of baby corn).  The white or wheat bread served with all salads is fresh and hot... warm chewy goodness.

Their pizza is excellent as well, especially if you like thin, crispy crust and different toppings.  Try the spinach and feta, yum.  Delivery can be slow, so pick-up is a better option.

The Potato Arrosto is no ordinary side dish. It's roasted and then immersed in duck fat and then topped with really pungent Provolone cheese. The potato smells. I was once trapped with it in a car and the windows were rolled up. My gawd, it was as if that potato made an announcement, ""I AM HERE!""

Funny thing is, when you get to Paesano's you will want to make your announcement. I sure did. I was excited to find out what this little dive sandwich shop was all about. The first thing I noticed was how small the place was. It was like a greasy spoon with counter seats but it was full of personality. The guys who were running the place were really friendly. One of them was wearing a shirt that said, ""Putting the love in your mouth"". Really, after locking your eyes on that, how could the ice not be broken? Time to get to that sandwich!

It was about 4 PM and Paesano's had run out of bread. Womp womp. They offered us wraps. And we were like wraps? Is this normal? And the Paesano's guys said when people walk in and all they have are wraps, that is what people take instead of bread. Food is so good at Paesano's that people will take it anyway, in any way and form. Luckily, Paesano's was able to steal back a few loaves from down the street. 

We got four Aristas to go. Some ate theirs that night, others indulged the next morning. I tried mine the next day. I put it in the oven to heat it up a little. The pork was still moist and the cheese melted over the broccoli rabe. The long peppers gave it so much heat that after each bite I yelled, ""Wow! That is SPICY! What a kick!"" It was a mean sandwich and I want another.

I'm not from Philly so this was a real eye opener to what Philly has to offer in terms of sandwiches other than cheesesteak and Dinic's. I still want Dalessandro's and Dinic's but Paesano's will definitely be another I will be adding to my Must Philly list when I visit. These sandwiches were not made for tourists but Paesano's welcomes out-of-towners with open arms regardless. In fact, they told us to bring our friends and family next time because, obviously, our little group of five was not enough.

It's a very cute, very small BYO tucked away at the northwest corner of 20th and Spruce in the Rittenhouse area. Everything about this restaurant was just right.. Nothing spectacular, but a just right neighborhood restaurant. The food wasn't dazzling, but it was certainly satisfying. The prices were a bit high, but not as high as others in the area, and within range of standard BYOs. The noise level was standard, loud enough that we couldn't hear very quiet talkers well, but not so loud it was distracting. The service was attentive if somewhat moody. 

I was there with a party of 6, and the key highlights from our orders were definitely the mussels, the brussel sprouts, and all three flatbreads. As I read the other reviews, it seems like a common complaint was that a meat dish was over- or undercooked. We ordered primarily small dishes from the antipasta and appetizer menus, no main plates.

My friend and I booked a reservation for Sunday evening, and it did not disappoint. Walking into the restaurant, there is a room with a cafe that had a bunch of sandwiches and beverages. It looked like a really neat spot for lunch/brunch, but we were here for dinner. We were seated immediately and were tucked up in one of the elevated platformed seating. There was also an outdoor patio/garden that looked very nice, if it wasn't cold out. The decor was very elegant, and there was a row of seats facing the open kitchen that looked fantastic. 

On to the food. We ordered the baba ganoush to start, and the kafta kebab and karus baladi for our entrees. The place is very vegan friendly, but I will note that if you are allergic to nuts like me, beware because there are a lot of dishes with a variety of nuts. I want to make a special shout out to the pita bread there, which is incredible. They are puffed up like pillows, and baked to perfection. The baba ganoush was delicious, and I personally preferred it to the hummous. The eggplant base was the right amount of flavor with the occasional burst of sweet and tart from the pomegranate seeds. The kafta kebab and karus baladi were grilled and seasoned to perfection as well. I wil say that the kebab and fish were considerably smaller than I was expecting.

Sean, our waiter, was pretty attentive.  

I ordered a Strawberry Boing, which was ok, nothing spectacular though.  Now on to the food.  The food at Distrito is *sigh* GLORIOUS!  I ordered the Queso Fundido, which is like this duck and cheese bake.  They give you these mini tortillas and you can either spoon the QF out and put it on the tortillas or just eat it directly from the baker.  Keep in mind, they serve tapas, so the portions are small.  I also ordered the Platano y Crema (sweet fried plantain with cheese), which doesn't sound all that hot, but it tastes ABSOLUTELY delicious!  My friend ordered the Esquites, which is like this sweet corn, cheese and lime parfait - again doesn't sound too appetizing, but I tasted it and it was fabulous!

I ordered Mexican corn (of course) and Seared Tuna Tacos. This was my first time trying Mexican corn and I was pretty excited. Both dishes came out pretty quickly, which was great because I was starving after watching a movie. The corn was pretty good. I really didn't know what to expect, but all of the flavors worked very well and the corn was charred nicely. The tacos, on the hand, didn't work out so well for me. First, the menu just listed 'Seared Tuna', not indicating it was a taco or burrito. I had thought it was just a seared tuna steak by itself. Second, it's supposed to be seared, the tuna pieces came out well done. They might as well have opened a can of albacore tuna and threw it in a tortilla.

We got to the restaurant around 12:30 on a Sunday and the place was pretty crowded.  The hostess told us it would be a 20-45 minute wait, but less time if we opted to sit outside.  The weather was great that day so we said that was fine.

While we waited, we ordered some iced coffee beverages from the coffee bar and sat on the couch.  The food channel was playing on the tv on the wall, which seemed to make all of us that much hungrier (nice tactic).  Within 15 minutes, a table outside was ready and we chowed down.

I got the tofu scramble, which was a tad bland.  I know it's tofu so it's not the most flavorful option, but it didn't seem to be very seasoned at all.  That's okay though, because the two pieces of soy sausage meat that comes with it was bomb.  One of my friends got the blueberry french toast which is spectacular, and another got the breakfast burrito.  It looked enormous and very saucy.

Parking around this time was really hard just because it's a residential area and there are a couple of brunch places in the area. Surprisingly, there was no wait for a table. It's an extremely small place. It's more of like a residential house turned into a café. We were seated in the back, and I asked my boyfriend to switch places with me because I was sitting directly under a fan. The waitress overheard and said she would turn down the fan. 

The menu is really small. On their website, and on yelp, I was expecting a pretty nice menu. It's a piece of paper folded in half with about 10 selections to choose from for food. I got the Genovese Omelet. My friends wanted to get some coffee, but didn't know what they wanted. The waitress asked what they were looking for. My boyfriend said he wanted something strong but not sweet. My friend said she wanted something not strong and sweet. She came back with these really cute lattes and cappuccinos. I may be mistaken about what they were, but they were pleasantly pleased with it.  

The food came out pretty quick. The Genovese omelet was huge. I was not expecting that big of a portion. It was delicious. It was a big filled omelet with avocadoes, pesto, goat cheese, chicken sausages and tomatoes. It was so good, although I'm not a fan of goat cheese, that was the only bad part of it. It came with a skewer of fruits (watermelon, pineapple, cantaloupe) and a small side salad. I was soooo full after this meal. It was huge and totally worth the money. 

The place itself is really small, but the service is fantastic. We had 2 different waiters come up to us and ask if we needed anything or if they could do anything. Our water was always filled. The table is small though, I felt like for 3 people, the table was only meant for two.  The menu is a mix of Lebanese food and French food. They do a great job bringing the two cultures together. 

I'd come back again!

Both are popular as dining formats on their own, and at most restaurants, you do one or the other....this is the first place I've been that does both. Like a traditional hot pot restaurant, each table has an induction burner in the center of the table where the hot pot goes.  They also have an infrared grill to cook the grilled foods. The menu is divided into the hot pot side, and BBQ side, and you can order from either or both (for a small upcharge).  They have a very good assortment of both hot pot and BBQ items, including meat, poultry, vegetables and seafood.  

The quality of the ingredients are average to above average. The one exception I had that was seriously deficient was the seaweed salad they bring as a table appetizer. It was obviously low quality, and dyed green. The sesame seeds were green. It was very off=tasting and I'd avoid it. 

The broth for the hot pot was very bland..I had the Chinese Herb and the Pork Bone. I was able to fix the up a bit by adding some chicken bouillon that they have at the sauce bar, which has a number of great ingredients for sauces . 

The infrared grill is ostensibly cheaper than a gas setup, but is not nearly as hot.  It took a long time to cook, and didn't sear the meet as well as I'd like.  I was able to turn up the heat all the way, and this helped somewhat. 

Overall, the place is just OK.  If you want top-notch hot pot, there are places that do it better. If you want BBQ, there are places that do it better.

First of all, this place would have gotten four stars from me had our service not been lacking.

My friend and I ordered an order of Herb Cherry Tomatoes for an appetizer, an order of the Shortrib and Cheddar French Fries and two burgers. 

Here's where the problem started - for those of you who had been to Village Whiskey, the place is tiny. So instead of bringing out the tomatoes as an appetizer and then waiting a few minutes for the burger/fries, all of our food came out at once which made us feel rushed and overcrowded. I am assuming (I could be wrong) that our waitress did not go and get our tomatoes early enough because there is no way it takes the same amount of time to assemble some tomatoes and cook a few burgers and fries so that was a negative.

The food was great. I don't think I have ever seriously tasted a serving of french fries as good as the shortrib fries. They just melted in my mouth and the kind of cheddar used was still something I am trying to pinpoint. Warning though, these fries are RICH so tread lightly and share with a friend.

I really enjoyed my burger as well. HUGE and tasty but just slightly on the dry side. Nothing I wouldn't come back for as I had leftovers for the next day that everyone at work was envious of! 

Our tomatoes were yummy. I described them to my friend as a ""big burst of sunshine in my mouth."" Yum!

We ended our meal and were sitting there for quite some time until we asked another waiter to possibly get our waitress so we could get our check. The waiter (who had not served us before) said ""Oh, I didn't know you were finished."" and grabbed our check. Our waitress had apparently left and didn't let us know that another waiter would be taking over or to thank us in the slightest. 

I just felt for such a great reputation I expected a little more than just a sit down and throw some food on the table kind of experience. All in all I would come back and hopefully receive some better service...and chow down on some shortrib fries!",2012-02-16 05:24:55,Village Whiskey,118 S 20th St,Philadelphia,PA,19103,39.9514165949,-75.1737677917,4.0,1553.0,1.0,"{'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'CoatCheck': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{u'breakfast': False, u'brunch': False, u'lunch': None, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': None, u'dessert': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'DriveThru': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': True, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': True, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}"", 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False'}","Bars, Nightlife, Whiskey Bars, Burgers, Restaurants, American (New)","{'Wednesday': '16:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-21:0', 'Friday': '16:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-21:0'}"

Came here twice already on a weekend and it was delicious both times. Of course, I got crepes both times and thank goodness I came with three other people because we were able to sample a bit of everyone's food. Everything was delicious! 

The sweet crepes were typical of what crepes normally about so I don't quite think it's worth the price. However, they are delicious (see pics)! Their hazelnut ice cream is YUM! The only problem I have with them is that they can become overly sweet after a few bites because it sure is a lot of sugar. I'd definitely split with someone if you could and get one sweet crepe and one salty one. 

As for salty crepes, the two I got to try were delicious! The ingredients were fresh and everything tasted very well balanced. On the weekends, they have a special brunch menu of crepes you can savor. Definitely try the Scrambled Eggs with Roasted Poblano Peppers, Tomatoes, Swiss Cheese,Avocado Corn Salsa & Caramelized Tomato Sauce.  The Creamed Spinach, Grilled Chicken, Tomatoes & Swiss (see pic) is one of the ""House Recommended Savories"" and I thought this was really yummy also (I replaced the creamed spinach with sauteed). 

Either way, definitely check this place out. There is also plenty of seating inside so it won't be too hard to get a seat (unlike Sabrina's and Morning Glory). It is also very cutely decorated  and they also have patio seating.

But that's not all!
no.  There's more!

I was considering the sauces to choose from and went with the first, the Harissa Aoili, which the nice girl at the register recommended and when I went looking at the cheeses, she admitted it really doesn't need it.  Im glad she was honest because she was dead on right.   So I grab my bottle of wooder and sit down for my 20 min wait.  (made fresh, whatta ya want, fast foood? well golly, no.)  Ok, so it arrives with a smile to my table and oh yeah it's surrounded by a mote of cheese balls.  Oh, I didn't need them, I ate em though.

They were very good but almost reminded me of like a sweet potato or cauliflower gluten free gnocchi. Not sure if they are or not to be honest. The truffle cream sauce was good but it was very strong and I couldn't eat a ton of it. I managed to scarf down the entire dish despite how full I was because I did enjoy the cloudy texture of the gnocchis. Wel made even tho they seemed veggie based ?

We were here for lunch and the lunch specials ranged in price from $10.45 - $12.95. Again, a bit higher than you would expect for Chinese lunch options and the portions are adequate, but not very large. 

We ordered the Dan Dan noodles as an appetizer. They were very tasty, but make sure you can bear the heat, because they are spicy.

The taste wasn't what I expected but overall was O.K. Not anything special in my opinion. 

Overall, the place is designed modern and cool and gets a lot of customers (very popular among young Asian people). And the waitresses and waiters are kind and down-to-earth. The place is smaller than I expected, but overall was pleasant to sit in and just talk and eat among friends. The only bad side is how expensive that is, and is the only reason why I don't like going there(also because of an incident where I asked to package my noodles to go and they packaged it for me, only to have it spill just outside the restaurant because they put it in a styrofoam container and the noodle had spicy sauce in it. Regrettably, the waiter was dumb enough to not put it in a quart container and ruined my pants that I was wearing. No I was not swinging the bag wildly from side to side. ) However, the place looks wonderfully modern and hip, but the food is overpriced, and over-exaggerated,and UN-fulfilling to be honest.

I arrived with a large group for lunch without a reservation and although it was booked, the manager was able to wrangle us up a table. The bisque had chunks, yes chunks, of delicious lobster and slight kick of flavor. Plus, I had the best piece of steak ever! The 6oz Filet Mignon was tinder and flavorful and enough to leave me stuffed. Plus, the roasted mashed potatoes was the perfect side to the dish. The only con on my visit, but not worth taking away a star, is I ordered the chocolate mousse dessert to-go. Instead, they packaged me a cheesecake. It wasn't bad since it was good but cheesecake isn't my favorite dessert.

I came here last night on a date and ordered the Caesar Salad. It looked unique and came with hush puppies instead of croutons, which sounded delicious. Darling, I took one bite of this salad and could hardly get it down it was so salty. I am a huge fan of salt, perhaps too much, but this was disgusting. I had to send it back. Our server asked if I wanted another without the ""added salt"" and I declined. I was so turned off. I told him I would just wait for dessert. 

My date ordered the hot chicken buns and said they were way too buttery. 

Well, when dessert came, I was equally as disappointed. I am a die hard fan of funfetti cake and was really excited to try theirs. Little did I know, their icing is cream cheese icing. Disgusting. Who in their right mind puts cream cheese icing on funfetti cake!? You monsters! 

Finally, when we were eating dessert, we were asked 6 times if we were done yet. 6! Twice by our server, once by the hostess (why was she even doing that?), and three times by other staff. I don't know if somebody had reserved this specific table for a time (it was a 2 person table by the window), or if they could tell we weren't going to spend any more money there, but we felt like we were being pushed out. There were plenty of other seats around us open, so it's not like they needed the space...The last time we were asked if we were finished, I had to ask the guy ""do we need to go? Does somebody need this seat or something?"" And he said no, but another person came back 2 minutes later.

Mac and cheese appetizer is a large portion great for sharing, or to order while you're waiting for the rest of the food.

Turkey club sandwich is too tall to properly eat.  Turkey is dry (although fresh), so be sure to order extra mayo on the side.

Caesar salad has a very weak and slightly acidic dressing, it's not really a traditional version, but it's good.

Omelette's are huge and cooked great.  Feel free to order off menu and make your own special requests.

I came to this place last night because it fulfilled all of my requirements: relatively close to my location, had mojitos, and the only thing that really matters: nachos.

This place has pretty regal stairs at its entrance, although I'm not difficult to impress. The ambiance is dark with a dimly lit interior and very unique decor. Reminds me of an old-school library actually. 

We slid ourselves onto two corner bar seats and were presented immediately with menus. 

I, being the rebellious bitch that I am, ordered two things I could not find on the menu however insisted on consuming anyway. They were kindly able to accommodate my request for a michelada AND nachos (even though the interwebz menu contained nachos). Despite the fact that I don't really care that much about the details regarding nachos, I inquired and the bartender stated the toppings included cheese, beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and chicken or beef. I, obviously, requested no onions and no meat. A-$ was craving a mojito. 

The drinks came first. I haven't had a michelada in a while so it was quite a pleasure to reunite that shit with my tongue. mmmm, those spices! I am particularly partial to a beverage with a nice kick. 

As a side note, the menu contains a shitload of margaritas and tequila options (DUH). In retrospect, I feel silly having not ordered this but the heart wants what the heart wants. 

One of the bartenders slid a plate of tortilla chips in front of us with the side of guac I ordered with the nachos and a smoky, chipotle-flavored salsa. Thankfully, the salsa didn't have giant chunks of a bunch of shit I don't like and was instead, nice and smooth. The bartender sneakily slipped a bowl of some shit resembling pico de gallo next to the salsa. 

The tortilla chips were delicious. Not a stale, knock-off version of tostitos provided by some other places. The salsa was smoky and the guac flavorful. Some time passed. I began to panic this was the nachos I ordered. I marched up to the other end of the bar with the bartender and aggressively inquired about what we had been served, assuming this was the nachos. He kindly informed me that the nachos were coming, and not to worry. PHEW.

The nachos did arrive. They were a medium-sized plate of a bunch of fucking delicious tortilla chips completely covered in cheese with a bean-paste underneath. Two tomato slices were gently placed on top. 

While this wasn't quite what I had in mind, who can complain about a plate of delicious chips covered in a thick and juicy layer of melted cheese? I may be full of shit here being a white american girl from westchester, ny but I feel like this is more authentic and what one might expect from nachos in the motherland (mexico). 

Ultimately I was very satisfied. I did notice that the menu was on the steep side. This is a cool spot with a great and unique ambiance. I would definitely check it out if you're in the mood to break away from the generic restaurant mold.

More specifically, the Sunday Tasting Menu. Thanks to having MLK Day off, we were able to take advantage of the BYO restaurant without worrying about going to work the next day with a slight wine headache.

We opted for the 8pm reservation and arrived promptly at 8pm to be seated without any delay. Our waitress quickly took our bottle of wine to be chilled. The first course was brought out, which was a salad with a blood orange vinaigrette. Following the salad was a Tuna tartar which was amazing. The tuna was fresh, the jalapenos added some heat, and the garlic sauce really brought the dish perfectly together.

Following this second course, out came a potato puree soup with a perfectly cooked scallop with leeks and a dried mustard. I couldn't get enough of this soup.  I do wish there was a little bit more of a sear to the scallop, but it was still as close to perfect as a scallop can come. 

During this dish, my husband and I looked at each other, somewhat disapointed, wondering if this was the 3rd course and was this supposed to be an entree? does that make dessert next? We were still hungry and wondering if we made a mistake to our dinner choice. Much to our surprise, out came a 4th course, much more of the entree we were looking for. They came out with cobia? Which I had never heard of previously, and it was amazing! It reminded me of a swordfish, but so much better!

The dessert was good- not amazing. But I dont think someplace like ""Little Fish"" should be known for desserts.

Overall, an amazing meal, especially for the price point of $33 for this 4/5 course tasting menu.

I will warn future visitors- the table next to us let the waitress know he had a nut allergy- and he seemed to have to miss out on a few elements of each course. If you have an allergy, I would recommend calling ahead to let them  know or ask what the tasting menu consists of- it might not be worth it to you if you have this kind of allergy, as everyone is served the exact same meal throughout the courses!",2013-02-04 17:59:05,Little Fish,746 S 6th St,Philadelphia,PA,19147,39.939989,-75.152854,4.5,529.0,1.0,"{'Caters': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'Corkage': 'True', 'BYOBCorkage': ""'yes_free'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '3', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""'none'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}""}","Seafood, Restaurants","{'Thursday': '17:0-21:30', 'Friday': '17:0-21:30', 'Saturday': '17:0-21:30'}"

Highly praised by Iron Chef Jose Garces, DSG offers cheap, and most importantly, delicious bites. How good is it? Iron Chef Garces sources his soup dumplings from DSG for his new Revel Casino restaurant, Yuboka. The one caveat associated with DSG? It used to be in a dumpy location behind Reading Terminal Market.

But all that's changed now - DSG has moved to a better location on Race Street, replete with a sleek interior design. So before heading to Hop Sing Laundromat for some drinks, the GF and I met up with some friends for good eats in Chinatown.

The Da family came to Philly in 2008 to represent Shanghai's style of dim sum. The head chef, Shizhou Da, is the fifth generation of the original four chefs who created the first soup dumping. With the assistance of her daughter, who runs the front of the house, they've created a restaurant that's becoming a popular spot for Philadelphians to grab a delicious bite.

DSG does take reservations, though it seems as though this simply gets you a table quicker, rather than providing you with a seat at a designated time. Still, without one, you'll be waiting in line for a bit. On a Saturday night around 7:30PM, the line was about half an hour deep, though the turn around was relatively quick.

Pro tip? DSG is BYO! So bring on some bubbly or some wine to pair with your dim sum and start your night off right.

Pan Fried Beef Dumplings [$5.75]

But on to the food. Dishes here come as they're prepared so don't expect any sort of coursing. But no matter. We started off with deliciously gluttonous pan fried dumplings, with a meaty exterior that was nicely crisp. And inside? Sweet and savory pork. These gorgeous bites are meant to dipped in the vinegar and chili oil provided at the table.

Vegetable Fried Rice [$7.50]

The veggie fried rice was really good as well. Though a bit salty, you could taste each individual grain of rice, which was the main component for this melange of scallions, eggs, and carrots. This was a larger portion than it looks and was quickly devoured.

Double Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce over Noodles [$6.95]

The pork with garlic sauce was available to come atop rice or noodles. The noodles were clearly hand-crafted and simply amazing. It's a bit cumbersome to eat for date night, so I'd advise you not to wear a crisp white shirt. But the noodles are definitely worth it - the texture and the way it holds the garlic sauce is simply superb. And the tender pork combined with baby bok choy and celery? Savory, sweet, and texture abounds.

Shanghai Wonton Noodle Soup [$6.95] 

This isn't your Americanized Chinese food joint's won ton soup. The broth is clear and deep. The wontons are well-crafted and large, filled with abundant portions of pork. Not overly salty, this soup will fill you up for under $7.

Stewed Chicken Over Rice [$5.95]

For the stewed chicken, we went with the rice. The moist and tender chicken came with a gravy that was rich. With baby bok choy on the side, this definitely eats like a meal - for under $6.

Pan Fried Beef Potato Cake [$3.80]

And if anything is a must order (other than the soup dumplings), it's these pan fried potato cakes. A gluttonous form of Chinese latkes, there was richly seasoned beef and potato bits within. And the crispy exterior offered great texture.

Shanghai Pork Soup Dumplings [$5.75]

But what are we really here for? The infamous XLB. For everyone other than myself, this was the first adventure into soup dumplings. So naturally, some instruction was needed so the night didn't end with peoples' mouths being scalded.  

Simply grab your dumpling with your chopsticks and place them on your soup spoon. Then, pierce the skin to allow some of the hot broth to seep out. Slurp and then take a big bite of the dumpling. Sweet, savory, and then sweet again. All filled within a gossamer thin fresh dumpling wrapper. I could easily eat three orders of these in one sitting. 

Crab & Pork Soup Dumplings [$6.25]

But on this occasion, we had to try the crab and pork iteration as well. The scent and taste of the crab comes on the forefront, with the pork taking over on the end. I prefer the regular pork soup dumplings, but this offers a nice change of pace for those inclined for surf and turf. 

So at Dim Sum Garden, for under $60, a party of 4 can get their fill of great food to start off the night. But really, I'd pay twice as much for these Iron Chef-endorsed soup dumplings.

We were looking to sit outside, but once we entered the restaurant and saw the beautiful décor and gigantic open windows, we were happy to take up residence at a table indoors.  The restaurant was surprisingly empty for 1 p.m., but this only made for more attentive service and a fantastic table by one of the aforementioned windows, across from The Academy of Music.  

Fresh crusty bread and hummus was promptly placed on our table, and a complimentary cocktail was offered with our brunch order.  I asked for a bellini, praying that a classy place like Estia would get it right and use fresh peach juice instead of schnapps or some other imitation of the real thing.  The bellini was dropped at my table and was perfection; so much so that my friend made the switch to a bellini for her second round.   

My ""avga spanakia,"" which I requested with egg whites, was unique and very good.  It was supposed to include spinach, leeks, feta, scallions and tomato, but there was not any tomato in my dish.  It was served in an iron skillet and was very hot and bubbly, which I loved.  The side of sausage that I ordered never made it to the table; our server said they had run out.  Not a big deal, as the omelet came with a side of pita wedges and a small dish of chive-seasoned potatoes, which was more than enough. My friend had a smoked fish platter, which she seemed pleased with as well.

That's as many maki rolls, nigiri pieces, dumplings, tiny salads with ginger dressing and fancy plates full of goodness as you can possibly fit inside your stomach.

For just $26.

I'm sure when I have come to Aki, I've eaten at least half my weight in sushi, which comes out to approximately $2,014 in US dollars.

Honestly, I would understand their pricing here more if the sushi was mediocre. Or if the service sucked. Or if the drinks were crappy and overpriced.

But no....nope. None of that.

Sushi is on point. Fish is fresh, all of it is made right before your eyes on the elevated sushi bar in the back.

Service is stellar. I've been with groups large and small, and they have always been accommodating, speedy and friendly.

And the drinks are moderately priced, of a varied selection and expertly crafted cocktails have been tasty.

It's a dive bar ambiance, everyone looked so laidback. I had to waited about 10 mins to get a table, but the server would take your name and your phone #, so when you table is ready, you will get noticed through text. 

Yes, their margarita $4 and nachos $5 are the best deal for happy hour. Very good margarita, huge yet delicious nachos for just $5! You can't beat this deal! 

My friend and I ordered some tacos, unfortunately, tacos are just mediocre.

They have a large and varied menu and everything I've had has been really great. Great enough for me to overlook the general grunge-stickyness of the restaurant as well as the occasional lack of actual dishware. It's byob (for now) and we were provided with solo cups for our sparkling wine which might have been an aesthetic choice or a clever ploy to make us go through the bottle that much faster.

All of their dumplings are solid options and rise to greatness with liberal use of their dumpling sauce. I would actually recommend getting some of the more basic dishes here like chicken skewers which arrive hot enough to scald all the skin off your mouth and fried rice which comes untainted by soy sauce and therefore becomes a perfect carrier for any other sauces from all the other dishes you've already ordered.

I have been to Johns countless times, well before my yelp days, so why not give these guys their props. Without a doubt this is by far the best spot in South Philly to get a Roast Pork sandwich. Everyone comes here because it is nothing but pure bliss waiting to be devoured. Sorry DiNics, as much as I do enjoy your roast pork  you're ranked second in my opinion when it comes to roast pork, John's has this won. 

This corner joint is always busy with a mob of people trying to get their hands on a delicious , full flavored , mouth watering, juicy sandwich. These guys will always be here, nobody can perfect a sandwich like them. They accommodate all from the suits to the contractors, everybody comes here. 

I was in the area and why not treat myself to a fantastic lunch , and why not stop here.  Now I will say this , as many times I have been here I have never tried their cheesesteak. Something about that pork that just makes you forget what you originally intended to get . I have no issues of going back and try to make another attempt in perusing the cheesesteak scene, trust me it is a challenge I must accomplish . 

My perfect roast pork starts with a great seeded roll holding in all the juices as best as it can. Its all in the type of bread that one uses that can  make or break a sandwich. Places like John's stand out the most because of the type of roll, they use.  While my sandwich is getting its proper treatment I follow it up with sharp Provolone ,with long hots. This is the perfect combination, a perfect way to compliment one to another. The ingredients they use to make that pork , simply put delicious. Heaven on a seeded roll waiting for you to sit and enjoy.   

These guys have it down, where there is no confusion , no long wait for sandwich what so ever. Once you come in you order , slide to the right, pay the lovely lady and get your eat on.  

Cash only, so if you bring plastic you might here some ""Booos"" from the crowd. I will be back again, this time I will be getting a cheesesteak.

At the table, they give you water in large bottles for the table and leave them on the table so you can serve yourself but will give you more should you need it. In my party, people had the Bloody Mary, and the Bellini- the passion fruit and the peach. They looked great and tasted good! The coffee tasted a bit watered down. 

Our meals were all really good. The only weird thing was that one person got an English muffin and it wasn't toasted and that was just odd. But it was all great otherwise!

Up there with my favs is the Beef Tendons in Chili Oil. I've tried the cumin lamb, Spicy Crispy Cucumber, and Eggplant w/ Garlic Sauce dishes, which are great, but if you are on a budget,  go for what is unique and unmakeable in the kitchen of Teresa L.   

The longest wait at this restaurant is at the door, especially if you don't have a reservation. Food otherwise comes in a timely manner, and as long as it remains a BYOB (which is not very long *weep*) and you're with a rowdy group, the Office of Complaints is closed. 

Word to the wise: Abnormal noise levels and unbridled sweating could really put a damper on candle-lit intentions.

As most reviews note, Le Bus is known or breakfast/brunch. It's probably the best place in Manayunk for recovering the morning after. But it's also great for lunch, dinner, and late night snacks. In fact, they are often serving food when lots of other places have closed, such as Monday nights at 9pm, when Manayunk is a ghost town. 

The menu features a nice mix of American cuisine, embellished with flourishes from other flavor profiles, like Thai. The highlights of the dinner menu include: thai turkey salad, the honey chipotle wings (these are awesome), and I think their nacho plate is quite good. All of the food is well prepared and nicely presented. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. 

The bar has a decent array of liquors and wines, and beer selection is all craft on the taps (mostly stuff you've had if you try lots of beers) and domestics in bottles. The bar area is spacious, comfortable, and pleasant to sit at. 

The best part of Le Bus is the people. It's locally owned, and you can tell that the owners put a lot of pride into it and run a tight ship. They hire all really nice people to work there, the kitchen crew is clearly in sync, and the exposed kitchen is immaculate. Seriously immaculate. I was watching them scrub down the room at the end of the night and was super impressed.

I remember this one time I called in to place an order for pick up and they did not answer their phones at all. I called at least 10 times and my cousin as well.

The service was good. Our party of three included a child and they handled his rowdy nature well. 
I ordered a cocktail that was simply divine, I think it was called Art of Fall. It was creamy and grape flavored. 
The food was all very well prepared. 
We started with an appetizer of Lobster which looked artful on the plate and was creative. 
I ordered the Charcuterie and was pleased with the 3 options of meat and bread that came with it. 
We then ordered steak, what else will you order. I had the steak tasting and it was fun to try the three different styles of meat. You could taste the slight differences. It was a large portion of meat. It was cooked spot on. Nothing comes with the meat, no sides or sauces. 
My wife ordered a sirloin that she thought was delicious. 
We also had a side salad that was good and huge. 
My son had the Mac and cheese, he was absolutely thrilled with it and stated it was as good as his favorite place to order it from. 
We then went to a dessert round. 
I ordered a butterscotch sundae, I was slightly disappointed. It needed more ice cream or creamy flavor to balance the portion out. 
My wife had a chocolate hazelnut dessert that was the best of all. 
My son for some reason ordered the bon bons and ended up not eating them. Because they were all dark chocolate and one lemon. 
He loved his tea that came out in a fancy system.

First Course- sheep's milk ricotta
Second Course- torchetti
Third Course- salted caramel budino

Ricotta was creamy and came with awesome bread, I highly recommend this. Torchetti tasted like Chef Boyardee, although the meat that was in it was tasty.

The first time I went into the South Philly Tap Room it was with my mom, an ER nurse at St. Agnes at the time.  Her boozy nurse, cop and fire-fighter comrades would gather at the new SPTR to celebrate the end of another shift saving lives.  We ate crab and artichoke dip, among other, not-at-all-memorable items, and I favorably reviewed the meal and upstart beer selection for my Temple News column. 

In the intervening years, SPTR has gone from a beer oasis to one of the most consistently tasty and different gastropubs in town.  The fried chicken that is being served right this minute --an orgy of wing, thigh, breast and drummie-- is one of the best I've had north of the Mason-Dixon. 

""Mexican construction worker"" headcheese tacos for $1 was our go-to cheap appetizer of summer 2009.  Aggressively gilded with jalapenos and superhot salsas, the tiny, rich tacos were weird, provocative and quite simply delicious.  Even the fries, which are more like a British chip-style, are extraordinarily enjoyable. 

The beer selection is still outstanding, and the service, while not perfecto, has certainly improved.  Many of the staff are extremely competent in addition to being friendly and unpretentious. 

I'd recommend SPTR to anyone looking for a memorable, upmarket pub dinner.

But since 7 of my reviews pop up when you type ""slacker"" into the search box (I was expecting more too!), I may as well make this #8 to state the reason. But this review is key, because I'm happy to jump up and rave about the biggest improvement that I have ever come across since revisiting a place!

Before I went to Sidecar I was instantly a fan. But then again any place that has held as many Zappa and Weyerbacher themed events as Sidecar has is instantly a friend of McThrill's! But when I went in to sample it during the moment that begat the review it hit some rough patches in service that left a horrible taste in my mouth despite the delicious food and Avery beer in my mouth. But despite that moment I knew that I was destined to comeback (the food and beer selection might even be worth braving zombies - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pao9v543K58). and ultimately I'm glad I did.

Overall the differences speak for themselves on this one. When I went on the first night I was totally skeeved out over the fact that I was directed towards a chalkboard behind me, completely away from my line of vision, and had another patrons skull blocking what little I was able to read! but during the last beer event I attended they had special beer lists made up for each table! The first time I went I was kind of down on how wobbly and uneven the table that we were sat at felt, and I even named it Rickety Cricket after my favorite It's Always Sunny character. But since then I saw that issue get immediate attention before we even sat down. The first time I came I was thrown off that it took 3 people to handle the basic server skills of one, even when it involved things like bringing the check and cashing out. But since that time I encountered a dynamo of a server on every occasion, who was one of the best I've encountered in this city. My only regret to this update other than slackerdom is that I forgot his name. So here's to next time!

The main thing that was amazing on both counts was the food and drink, even when the first time just offered fries and a chicken sandwich. But the other food occasion was a brunch that offered up more waffle varieties than most places, and an outstanding crab filled omelet. They also make a pretty awesome Bloody Mary that comes with a full stalk of celery and olives to boot!

Another reason why I need to update this is because when I hit up Kraftwork (an amazing place that I should *hopefully* get to reviewing before you can say slacker) with Felicia D. after working the Punk Rock Flea Market. Upon talking with him you could really tell that he was a stand up guy who knows the biz well, and  really tries to offer something that stands out to his patronage.

+ tuna tartare (one of our favorite dishes of the night. The tuna to avocado ratio was perfect, the tuna so fresh, and the crunchy crisps they added were a nice touch)

+ salmon sashimi (just melted in your mouth. Absolutely must order the salmon here. Came with 3 pieces so keep in mind when sharing)

+ edamame dumplings (I've heard a lot of rave reviews about this and I think they live up to the hype! I've never had these before and they taste almost like pierogies. They're served in a light broth and the dumpling wrap is nice and springy. Perfect blend of savory and not heavy)

+ shrimp tacos (so perfectly battered and lightly fried. Shrimp was so fresh. Just wish they'd added more avocado sauce)

+ Kobe beef robetayaki (very juicy, was not disappointed. Tasted great even without the recommend sauce)

+ pork jowl robetayaki (definitely my absolute favorite of the night. So tender and juicy, even my boyfriend who doesn't normally like pork loved it. I preferred this robetayaki over the kobe beef)

+ chicken teriyaki entree (this was just chicken, no carbs included. The meat was very tender and I thought the whole dish was well made but kind of underwhelming compared to the other dishes. For $17, I would not order again. It also got boring after the second slice of chicken. If this were a small plate instead of a larger entree I would have liked it a lot more)

+ seaonal eel over rice special entree (served with pureed avocado sauce. It was good, just a bit salty. This came last and we were too full by this point to finish it. Not sure if I'd order it again) 

Our bill came out to a total of about $130 including tax and tip so we were glad we hadn't opted for the chefs choice special, which would have been 60 per person (before tax and tip) and would have given us way too much food. We would have forgone the chicken teriyaki entree and the meal would have been perfect. Small plates definitely impressed us more.

They also gave us complimentary champagne because it was our anniversary. A complimentary dessert of chocolate and strawberry mochi was also served. They stuck a sparkler in one of the mochis and it was really fun and cool! 

Definitely recommend dinner here, especially for a date!

Everything was fine until a couple guys who had reservations came in and I had gotten out of my seat to go for the quick bathroom break.

They told my friend a 45 minute wait, but it was definitely shorter, maybe only about 30 min, which is a plus. The waiting area has a couch, and you can get take out coffee (or sit on the couch coffee) and eat at the counter, which is a definite plus - even though we didn't do this.

The menu looks good, covers most of the brunch traditional foods: breakfast burrito, tofu scramble thing, omelette, two types of eggs benedict, pancakes, some different types of french toast - they had specials too. I opted for a sandwich with sweet potato fries - an italian panini with roasted red peppers, artichokes, mozzerella, basil, tomatoes, prosciutto.

Sandwich. was. delicious. plus a star for sure.

Fries were really soggy. minus a star.

I asked the waitress if I could get new ones, she said they are always like that. (Really? How is it that every other restaurant in Philly manages to get them right?) She talked to her manager, who said that sweet potatoes have more moisture in them, so they are always soggier. Weird, cause my friend's sweet pot fries weren't so soggy. Anyway, she was nice and offered to bring me something else instead, blah blah.  I didn't really want anything else, but I didn't eat them either. I love fries, a lot, and these were definitely inedible. 

My sister got a dish called the Kitchen Sink. It comes in a skillet, and has a biscuit, eggs, potatoes, sausage gravy, cheese .... utter deliciousness for only $9. They earned a star back for that one.

They have 3 different types of hot sauce which I liked. Iced coffee that is actually iced coffee. Great service, but the food took awhile. Oh, and if you have kids - there isn't a separate menu, but there are menu items marked with a ""K"" which means that they can make them into kid sized/friendly meals. Not sure what that means, but there ya have it.

I had a nice experience here, delicious sandwich, but I really love my fries, and places that screw them up and then try to pass it off as normal - is well, disappointing. I might have given 3.5 if I could have.

OG Cheu Noodle Bar is pretty small inside, but there is quite a bit of seating packed in there.

My inner Greek has been appalled at my lack of authentic Greek cuisine intake (ok, we can argue about Cypriot vs Greek, but I'm not nit-picky like that - plus good food is good food). In fact, my bf has eaten there so often that HE thought I'd already been there before! I had to remind him that generally girls aren't invited to boys' brunches.

We made last minute brunch plans with friends after much discussion on which brunch place to choose. Kanella had availability for the four of us on Sunday, so we jumped at that instead of risking elsewhere. It was PACKED when we arrived, so reservations seem to be a must for brunch. Our friends hadn't eaten there before either, so my bf got the chance to recommend dishes. He and one of our friends went for his favorite, the Cyprus Breakfast, whereas our other friend got the roast lamb sandwich and I had the Shaksouka. 

We didn't have to wait long, thank goodness because boy were we hungry! I have to say, the food was delicious in it's Mediterranean simplicity of ingredients, and the brunch is very reasonably priced. The coffee was also quite good, Service was pretty good overall, and we never felt rushed and lingered a little bit over coffee and a shared baklava (perhaps the two things I felt were moderately expensive - those two itty bitty pieces of baklava? Seriously not what I consider a full portion).

This isn't your traditional eggs benedict spot or a place to get $6 eggs with meat and potato.  It is, instead, an experience from beginning to end.  The atmosphere is casual and inviting yet sophisticated.  The service was top notch, not stuffy, and very attentive to water and coffee glasses the entire time.  A key to quality service is the top-off of coffee after you've signed the check; our water and coffee remained fully attended-to until we left.

I had the Fresh Baked Biscuits & Gravy with pan fried lamb sausage, tomato ""gravy"", and spicy hot pepper jam.  Phenomenal.  I could eat this every weekend.  The biscuits were a touch dryer than I would have normally preferred on their own, but they worked perfectly well with the gravy and jam.  This is one of those dishes that you will crave and I hope it doesn't disappear off the menu.  The garden brunch with seared scallops and a farro salad, with veggies, and lemon and chive vinaigrette was also a favorite at the table.  Four scallops seared perfectly for a tasty and satisfying, yet light, option.  

We had to try dessert right?  The meyer lemon ice cream with toasted angel food was out of this world, perfectly tart.  The chocolate pudding tart was also amazing, served warm with pumpkin ice cream a dash of salt and caramel.  A perfect ending to a perfect brunch.  Our tab with coffee, entree, and dessert (including tip) came to about $40/person.

The decor and setup is similar to Barbuzzo and Little Nonna's in that it's kind of dark and rustic, and it's not a big space, so it can be tough to move around the place.

As far as food goes, Lolita does not disappoint. They have a nice take on Mexican food, and it shows in their ingredients and presentation. Another great thing with the food is that with small exception, all their food is gluten-free. We shared an order of short rib nachos, which were delicious, and I ordered chicken tacos and plantains.

I came here twice in the same week, one day of which happened to fall on the 4th of July. The added hustle and bustle of the holiday proved to be just too much for the host/hostess, server, bus boy, and in the end Han Dynasty as a whole. 

My wife's and I first visit went rather well. We started with the dan dan noodles and also ordered some house-made lime and mint ginger ales (both awesome). The first entree we had was the long pepper chicken which was mostly red peppers and very small pieces of fried chicken which had more batter and coating than actual chicken. I wasn't impressed. Our second entree was the garlic sauce style beef. This was just okay too. 

Our second night there, the inconsiderate and inexperienced new host at the door was playing hopscotch with the line of customers, selecting people who had smaller or larger parties to go ahead of the people who had been waiting longer. When we asked the other hostess why this was the case, she apparently had no idea and had to pull the first host aside and tell him that he's not a bouncer at a club, everyone is allowed inside. We wasted a lot of time waiting. 

Reluctant to stay much longer we finally got a table only to be asked two minutes later if we could move to another and smaller table. No thanks. Did you mess up again? This time it needs to be at your expense, not ours. 

Our server was the most absentee server I've ever had. I had to ask a bus boy walking by if he could bring me a new dish since it was clearly dirty. He took the dish to the back and later a different server brought me the same exact dish back that was dirty in exactly the same spot with the same marks. 

Everything we ordered came swimming in oil and our waiter forgot that we had actually wanted to order a third dish. By the time he remembered us, there was no need. Definitely do not order the chef specials, they are just served in a bowl of nothing but oil and are just plain gross.

A few of my faves:
 - Vegetable Samosas - these are super stuffed.  The ratio of filling to fried outer layer is superior to any samosas I've had from any other Indian joint in the area. 
 - Palak Paneer - spinach and cheese.  My most favorite Indian dish.  This dish got better since the first time I've had it from New Delhi.  I've noticed it to be less oily even at it's most spicy level (which is how I get it).  I thought that the oil contributed to the level of spice, but when I ordered this a couple of weeks ago it seemed to be spicy as hell but not to oily.  YUM!
 - Channa Saag - If you want the above but can't do the dairy, get this!  It's the same spinach as the above except they use chickpeas instead of cheese.
 - Chicken Curry - This is the bf's Indian food choice. ALWAYS. They don't skimp on the chicken and the sauce is awesome.
 - Plain or Garlic Naan - always need either of these to supplement the above. 
**Entrees come with their basmati rice which I LOOOOOVE!! 

They lose a star for the following reasons:
Their lamb can be a hit or miss. I've noticed some pieces to be more tender than others when ordering the Lamb Jal Farezi
Had the Chicken Vindaloo recently and the chicken was straight up dry.
Buffet - I don't find the food to be as fresh as when we get it to-go/delivered.

Prices are beyond reasonable for the amount of food you get.
They also have weekend discounts if you sign up for their email.  Deals are usually for 15% off for delivery or dine-in.
Ordering online is incredibly organized and convenient.

I went just before noon and there was hardly any line, although by the time I actually got my burger, the place had filled up. I ordered the SmokeShack burger. My first impression was that it looked awful small, but when I bit into it, it was pure deliciousness. The patty is so juicy, flavorful and delicious, the applewood-smoked bacon was to die for, and that Shack sauce is addictive. The pickled cherry peppers added a nice hint of acidity to complement the richness of the flavors.

It was small, but I felt perfectly satiated after eating it. Not overfull, but I wasn't hungry again for another five hours. I also had the Abita root beer, which I thought was extremely thirst-quenching and tasty. It was not overly sweet, either.

I didn't order fries. The lady at the counter tried to push them on me (""No fries?!"") but I thought that sounded like too much food, and if I had room left over, which I didn't, I would have ducked into Capogiro across the street. When I saw other patrons' pitifully small and very Ore-Ida-looking crinkle fries, I was so glad I didn't waste money or calories on them. Shake Shack really needs to step up its fry game, that is just sad!!

All in all, I would definitely go back. No, it's no Village Whiskey, but it's definitely a solid entry in the category of moderately-priced burgers. I'd like to also echo others here in saying that the service is very friendly.

First of all, five stars for service and working with me to accommodate my party which actually grew in size.  We started as four, and then grew to six when my friend wanted to come.  Although I only called for the original reservation four days in advance for 5pm on a Friday, staff was able to help when I called two days later to make it six.  Normally, they only have the outdoor picnic table for a 6-top, but instead they kept us inside and moved some tables together.  Since we were in a ""hurry"" and had to be out before 6:45 for the 7pm show, we were told as long as we didn't linger around we could be seated for six people.  Now, when I called again to make it eight, they could not do that unfortunately.  

Our waiter was excellent and very on top of the whole meal.  He made recommendations for the toddler with us, and was just helpful throughout.

The food was great.  Three of us started with a Caesar salad and garlic bread.  The polenta croutons were excellent!  I liked mine, but everyone else did not care for the purple radicchio because of the bitterness and most of it went uneaten.  The garlic bread included cloves of garlic ready to be squeezed out like toothpaste and spread onto the buttered and toasted bread.  This was quite the hit!  Four of us went with the spaghetti and meatballs.  Of course, the meatballs just do not rank above my wife's homemade gravy and meatballs.  I thought they were very good and had a different flavor than what I'm used to at home.  These had a heavy sausage flavor.  The melted cheese inside was awesome and unexpected.  My wife and kids were not as much fans about the meatballs.  They are quite big as you can see in other Yelper's pictures. I really liked the gravy which was a hit for all of us.  The sauce had chunks of meat and the spaghetti itself was excellent.  We don't think we've had better pasta anywhere in Philadelphia.  My friend had the Sunday Gravy option which had multiple meats along with spiral noodles in gravy.  He liked it, but couldn't help but compare the gravy to Villa di Roma which he prefers.  My family and I like Little Nonna's.  There was plenty of leftovers to take home for a nice lunch (and I got to have all the leftover meatballs)!

We also had some nice sangria, and the restaurant allow you to even try the liquors (there were four of them) before deciding to buy.  Besides the sangria, we also tried the vodka lemonade, but my wife liked the sangria more so that's what we got.  My friend had two glasses of wine, and we finished with some great limoncello, which, surprisingly, wasn't homemade.

If my family had liked the food a little better, my 4.5 star would have easily gone to the five.  Instead, down to four, but we would come back.  All of us had a great time and again, the service was above average.

i decided to treat my fiance to an amazing dinner here and told him to order whatever he wanted and believe me, he did not hold back :)

we started with some cocktails, oysters, the famous cheesesteak, a steak and some lobster and some sides.

COCKTAILS: my boyfriend said his old fashioned was pretty good, maybe not worth $28, but a fricken good old fashioned. i got the not your mother's juice and it was good! very refreshing

OYSTERS: we got a half dozen all east coast and honestly, they're not as big as i'm used to. they were a bit of a let down, i probably would never order them here again unless they can reassure me they're big and juicy

CHEESESTEAK: well worth it, and it comes out with champagne which does a great job of cutting the heaviness of the steak. it was definitely THE BEST CHEESESTEAK i've ever had. and i know that it's not something you can splurge on often so i did my best and experiencing every second of this sandwich. we did ask to get it split into 4's; we each ate 1 piece, SCREAMED at how amazing it was and then saved the other 2 pieces for the next night (it was still amazing, if not better, reheated in the toaster oven in the comfort of our own home) and i also enjoyed the pickled peppers that came with the cheesesteak

STEAK: we got the A5 wagyu 18oz ribeye (aka the most expensive steak on the menu) and man it was BUTTER. melted in our mouths. some pieces were a little bit chewier than i'd like but it was amazing. 

LOBSTER: the butter poached lobster here is delicious as well as a big serving. it was cooked perfectly, could have had a TOUCH more seasoning but i was pleased

SIDES: we got the mashed potatoes and the broccoli rabe. for the pricing, i would expect a bigger portion. it was only 2 people and with all the food we ordered, we still cleaned up the sides and was left wanting more

TIPS: the house poivre sauce here is WAYYY too salty. i also hate that it's nowhere near the traditional style where it's creamy. i ended up asking for the horseradish creme fraiche which was delicious. the sides are way too small for the pricing here, especially if the guest is ordering the most expensive steak on the menu, you'd think you'd get your sides for free.

all in all, this is a good steakhouse, definitely not that you come to often. the ambiance is different than your typical steakhouse; it's set up like a library almost. some of the people here were dressed to the 9's while others were in sweatshirts and sweatpants which i thought was odd. it's an experience and YOU GOTTA GET THE CHEESESTEAK",2019-09-03 18:35:12,Barclay Prime,237 S 18th St,Philadelphia,PA,19103,39.9487096,-75.1708743,4.5,789.0,1.0,"{'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '4', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'BYOBCorkage': ""'no'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""'full_bar'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'dressy'"", 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': True, 'casual': False}"", 'Caters': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'BikeParking': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True'}","Steakhouses, Restaurants","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '17:0-22:0', 'Friday': '16:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '17:0-23:0', 'Sunday': '17:0-22:0'}"

100 people were asked ""which would Barney choose?""

""Pathetic!""

""Survey says.....99""

I can't tell you how legit sushi is here in the states compared to its origin - but I know that when I first got into sushi, maki rolls were simple light and fresh - and if I was lucky, had a nice little kick.

but it seems like we have begun americanizing maki, because this is the second place in a row where they add so much shit to a roll that things just get busy.  in this case, the rolls were topped with so much crap that if you were lucky enough to pick it up without it falling apart, there was no way it was all fitting in even my big fat Irish mouth.

and have you ever tried to eat a piece of maki in two bites - it doesn't work in general, and it's a downright disaster if it's a maki roll that somewhat resembles Tammy Faye Bakker.

and if you are going to make me work so hard, make it worth my while - but somehow this place managed to mix up so many textures and flavors and still elicit a 'Meh' after each bite.

But the good news is - the sushi doesn't make you gain weight....

because my two mediocre rolls cost me $38, and I threw up when I got that bill.  That's what happens when you trust the 'specials' menu.  It was special, alright.

I came here despite the less-than-stellar reviews from my fellow yelpers, but they all seemed to start with ""we came here after drinking a lot of booze somewhere else...""

that might explain why they rated it higher than I would - lucky bastards.",2008-08-05 18:31:19,1225Raw Sushi and Sake Lounge,1225 Sansom St,Philadelphia,PA,19107,39.9498493,-75.1615489,3.5,545.0,1.0,"{'BYOBCorkage': ""'no'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': True, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': None, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'Alcohol': ""'full_bar'""}","Japanese, Restaurants, Korean, Sushi Bars","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '16:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '16:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-22:0', 'Friday': '13:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '13:0-23:0', 'Sunday': '16:0-22:0'}"

overall, i was a bit disappointed! the meat on the burger itself was great; very flavorful and a good size, but the toppings (at least that we ordered, weren't stellar). important note: here they say the default temp on the burger is ""pink in the center"" and boy do they mean it. unlike 500 degrees where their medium rare is really a medium temp, at bobby's burger palace be prepared for an authentically medium rare preparation unless you tell them otherwise.

dallas burger: burger + bbq sauce + coleslaw + monterey jack cheese + pickles
i was sooooo excited for this burger. this was the reason i wanted to go to bobby's burger palace, but the toppings were just all MEH. the coleslaw, while providing good crunch, was flavorless! the pickles were the brightest flavor and despite my love for pickles, that is not ideal. i didn't really taste too much of the bbq sauce either. though disappointing, i'd try this again. after i try others.

napa valley burger: goat cheese + meyer lemon honey mustard + watercress
i normally love love love goat cheese, but did not like this burger. at all. didn't eat more than a few bites of it. it was heavy on the goat cheese, light on the watercress and who knows what the actual ratio of honey mustard is normally.
what i mean is, when they say watercress, they mean like 2 sprigs of it, so it may as well have been left off. AND as it turns out, they did leave the honey mustard off of our burger. sigh. they completely forgot the mustard. which we didn't realize until a few bites in. i wouldn't recommend this.

sweet potato fries with horseradish honey mustard
hands down, best sweet potato + condiment combination i have ever had. fries were crispy but substantial enough to have good tension. the horseradish honey mustard is AMAZING. i want to have this with me ALL. THE. TIME. it was just so interesting with that spicy kick and very slight hint of sweetness.

beer battered onion rings
HUGE rings. and THICK. these were like an inch high! that is crazy for an onion ring. but the batter tasted good and was not too thick. crunchy delish.

sante fe burger: queso sauce, jalapenos, crushed blue corn tortilla chips
brought one of these back as a take-out order. i only took one bite of this, but it was better than either the dallas or napa valley burger and that says a lot, especially considering it wast eaten about 30-40 minutes after initial preparation. the good thing for take-out orders is that they wrap the burger in foil so it stayed warm. the queso sauce was TASTY. cheesy and just salty enough. jalapenoes gave much needed kick. and the CRUNCHIFIED-NESS was great.",2010-10-27 19:34:38,Bobby's Burger Palace,"University of Pennsylvania, 3925 Walnut St",Philadelphia,PA,19104,39.954086811,-75.2009592271,3.5,788.0,0.0,"{'HasTV': 'False', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'DriveThru': 'False'}","Sandwiches, American (Traditional), Burgers, Restaurants, Salad","{'Monday': '11:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-22:0', 'Friday': '11:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-23:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-22:0'}"

FOOD HIGHLIGHTS:
// grilled romaine salad //
At first, I was skeptical about this dish, since pictures on Yelp made it seem like just a head of romaine placed unceremoniously on a plate. However, I was blown away when I tried it. It had the perfect crunchiness while having this wonderful smokey flavor. The crouton (made out of polenta?) was creamy and hot when I bit into it. The dish also came with bacon bits, cheese and a sauce drizzled all over it, which was extremely yummy paired with the more neutral tasting romaine. 

// vegetable paella //
This was pretty good; the asparagus in it gave it a nice crunch and red peppers for additional texture. 

// Oreo beignet //
LOVED IT. The beignet paired nicely with the cold ice cream (which tasted deliciously creamy), with a sprinkling of Oreo crumbs to top off the dish. 

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here! Although the food took quite a long while to come out, that may be because we had a large 20+ party.

Kobe sliders were good.  Tuna tartar was fresh and delicious.  Lobster bisque was out of this world.  Salads were average, maybe even below average.  

Steaks were less-than-amazing, which surprised all of the people in my group.  None of us had been to BP before but we're all steakhouse ""veterans.""  The steaks were all absolutely charred on the outside while being correctly cooked on the inside for the most part.  The rub they slathered the steaks in was odd, as well.  I appreciated that the NY strip was grass fed organic, and that was apparent in the flavor of the meat, but the bitter charcoal exterior really detracted from the natural flavor of the meat.  This sentiment was echoed by all of my party.  

The more traditional steakhouse goers in the group did not appreciate the trendiness, feeling it tried putting an institition like American steakhouses into a prettied up, club-like atmosphere.  I didn't echo this as I enjoyed the wood walls and modern tables and chairs.  

The mushroom side was AMAZING.  I'd strongly recommend.  The tatertots were not that great.  The asparagus was fresh and perfectly cooked.  

The wine list, my favorite part, was standard for a steakhouse.  Lots of big cali cabs and little else of note (outside of the 82 first growths like Cheval Blanc for $7400).  We settled on a $250 bottle of Plumpjack Cab that was fantastic (if carrying the steakhouse standard 200% markup).  This was probably the best part of the meal.

 - Get a vegetable board. It's good for you. Call your mother afterwards and tell her, she'll be so proud.
 - Order octopus whenever possible. No worries about overdone, polpo flavored chewing gum here.

food here is generally pretty good and sticks close to an authentic standard. here's a short list of caveats:
- do NOT try the tasting menu if you came for real sichuan food -- because what you'll get is a sampling of common chinese dishes and americanized chinese food
- the cocktails are generally good, but could use more alcohol and less sweet stuff

great dishes that i recommend:
STARTERS
- beef shank
- beef tendons
- dan dan noodles
- spicy beef noodle soup
ENTREES
- cumin dry rub (lamb)
- double cooked (pork)
- dry pot (any meats)
- stew hot sauce (fish)
- spicy tofu fish filets
 
haven't tried a lot of the misc dishes like clay pot, vegetables, noodles, etc. so can't speak much to those.

Family friendly, traditional,  and accommodates large groups pretty well,  yet not ideal for solo eaters. 

Located in Olney,  in a mini strip mall with plenty of free parking in the parking lot! Its definitely a traditional Korean BBQ Table restaurant with heavy family vibes. Korean channels playing on all the TV screens gives it a sports like vibe in a family setting. Note- If you're not Korean, you may be one of the only non Korean or non Asian there. So I guess it's traditional.  

My ratings are based on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. With 1 being tragic and 5 Ouuww Terrific! 

Overall ratings- 4 stars ( making space more comfortable for a solo dinner would make it 5 star. However, it's still far the best Korean restaurant in Olney, which is chalk full of traditional Korean BBQ table restaurants, so that's huge! 

Food Taste ( I only get the hot pots)-  5 star! 
The SoonDuBu Jigae ( Korean Spicy Soft Tufu Stew) is the absolute bizzzness yeezus! Perfect for a rainy day!  Oouuwwww.... 
Food portions- 5 star. Pretty great portions for price.
Customer service- 4 star 
Ambiance- 4 star but great for families. 
Cleanliness- 4.5 star 
Decor- 4 star . Not fancy but still functional traditional. 
 
Cool thing- you still get all the sides and condiments spread with any dine in order.

  I had heard raves about Sweet Lucys. I dont think ive ever had good BBQ before. This was an excursion (a journey) that I planned to make alone. Since there was interest from others, we decided to make an event out of it.

 I must admit that I knew nothing of the establishment. As many pointed out, calling this a Burb event was a fallacy.  While its a good 5 miles outside of center city, the area is very much urban.  I guess what separates it from center city haunts, is the fact that it has free and ample parking.

  I recently purchased a GPS unit for my car. Its been fun going to places I know and seeing if Garmin takes me the right way. More often than not, it doesnt, so when I had to rely on it to get me to Sweet Lucys, I was worried. It was definitely a white knuckle journey through the North East, but it did get me there...eventually. Honestly, without my little navigator ( who I have dubbed, Chewy) I might not have found it. Its one of those places that you need to know to find. Its tucked in the middle of Mayfairs factory district.

The next thing I didnt know about SL, was that it wasnt a sit down -get served restraunt. Its akin to 5 Guys, where you place your order at the counter and pick it up at the take out area. Its your choice whether to eat in (there is a small dining area) or take it home. We were a large group without a reservation ( or did we have one,? ask Tom C about that) and we didnt have trouble getting a table on a Friday night.

This review has been a whole lot of preparation and no H.  Lets get to the food.  It was amazing! Definitely worth the trip. Id go as far to say that the sides alone were worth the trip. I got Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Mac and cheese.  They were the best ive ever had outside of homemade. For the entree, I couldnt decide on the Pulled Pork Sandwich (which was highly touted) or the Ribs, so of course I got both. Never in my life have I had pork so good. I saved some ribs ( dont be fooled by the term 1/2 rack..there was more meat than 2 full racks at most restraunts) to share with family members, however the next day, I became as possesive as Gollum with his ring.  Im already planning a return trip and dreaming about the food. Prices were reasonable, considering the quality. Staff was efficient and friendly.

  A few observations about the unofficial Yelp event.....
   -  Lee M was my guide for the night. He is a Sweet Lucys veteran and was helpful in food choices and history. Thanks!
  _ Chad T and wife were awesome. Chad enlightened me that SL is BYOB and brought some delicious beers that enhanced an already great meal.
- Ian and wife were cool too, but someone needs to talk to Ian about his ""drinking problem"" :)
- Wouldnt be a Burb event (even when its not a burb event) without Kristin and Jeff. Im glad they left their kitty long enough to come out.
- We had some new blood with Jen R and her friend. They brought a fresh perspective and added alot of fun to the event.
- While Tom C didnt make it, we were reminded of his presence the whole night by an empty reserved birthday table that he reserved for us . Too bad it was none of our birthdays, Haha!

I have always wanted to come to this place.  I go to the Ritz V a lot and have always seen this venue popping with customers.  My visit was for lunch.  

I'll start off by saying it started off great and went downhill for each course.  I started off with the spicy calamari with Pickled Cherry Peppers | Goat Cheese.  I was very satisfied with this dish.  It had great calamari in a combination that enhanced the flavor.  I have never had goat cheese with calamari but I highly recommend it.  

The second course was:
Mahi Mahi
Flame-Grilled | Spaghetti | Capers | Roasted Tomato | Tarrago
Meh.  The fish was nothing flavorful and it was presented in a bowl of spaghetti in tomato sauce.  I could not differentiate the sauce from that which originates from a can so I was not impressed at all and was rather disappointed.

The 3rd course (dessert) was just pathetic.  The menu stated ""A Sampler of our Homemade Desserts.""   It was two miniature square cakes.  They were about an inch or so in diameter and about as thick.  That was gone in a minute.  

Let's move back to something I can actually compliment:  the interior decor of the venue.  This place looks cool from the outside and looks absolutely amazing from the inside.  There are giant prints of the Italian coast (the Positano coast?) on the walls and very stylish tables and other decorations.  The interior wraps around the central kitchen area so  all tables are close to the windows.  It is a place that is very pleasant to sit in for a date or family dinner.  The bathroom impressed me the most.  The wall and floor designs were museum quality as were the sinks.  

In summary, I would love to come back on a regular week and sample the regular menu.  The place seems to have potential.  

I would definitely love to come back to take selfies in the bathroom :-)",2018-10-13 15:18:24,Positano Coast by Aldo Lamberti,"212 Walnut St, Fl 2",Philadelphia,PA,19106,39.9466579,-75.144724,3.5,689.0,1.0,"{'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""'full_bar'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': True}"", 'HappyHour': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': True, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': True, 'saturday': True}"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': None, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'Music': ""{'dj': None, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True'}","Breakfast & Brunch, Lounges, Seafood, Bars, Nightlife, Restaurants, Italian, Tapas Bars","{'Monday': '11:30-22:0', 'Tuesday': '11:30-22:0', 'Wednesday': '11:30-20:30', 'Thursday': '11:30-20:30', 'Friday': '11:30-20:30', 'Saturday': '11:30-20:30', 'Sunday': '11:30-20:30'}"

Gyros are a specialty, and served traditionally like you find in Mykonos with fries inside! They are absolutely packed but only available for lunch. A fan favorite for sure! 

Don't forget the baklava! It's to die for here. Drenched in honey with perfectly crisp flaky layers. Oh em geeeeee!! Even if you're stuffed, take some to-go! 

Start with the roasted eggplant dip! It's heavenly. Heavy on the garlic, but oh so delish and served with perfect warm pita!!! (I'm a pita snob). Calamari is said to be a terrific starter as well. 

When I crave and miss Greece, which is very often, this is where I head. Everyone who has been to this Fairmount staple loves it, and everyone I take here for the first time does as well. A crowd pleaser for sure!

It's on the smaller side so larger parties may potentially be a bit of an issue, but call in advance if it's a special occasion. The family own joint is super accommodating and friendly. 

Bring those bottles of unmistakable clean, refreshing Greek white or some Ouzo because it's BYO! 

Parking takes a bit patience, but once you find a spot out front I believe it's 8 hours unmetered!

There restaurant itself is very cute and the server was super friendly.  Our waiter was not particularly nice but not rude either.  As for the food, it was good.  I shared the warm hummus and the octopus with the table.  The hummus was very salty.  I wasn't impressed by the pita that came with the hummus, I was expecting more fluffy pita, but it was thin and a little limp (but it was warm!).  The octopus app was very nicely done, probably the highlight of the evening. The chopped vegetables accompanied the octopus very nicely.  The entrees were also good, but nothing to write home about.

The place is located in a very rough neighborhood in the heart of Germantown so i wouldn't recommend going at night.  The service is literally slow motion. I was in line of 6 people for about a half hour and it was not pleasant. When we finally got to the register, the lady couldn't get it to work and we were stuck for another 5 minutes. Several people walked inside and solicited us to buy oil scents and sunglasses as we were waiting in line and couldn't wait to get out.  There were a few flee market style tables outside selling weird items. We came here at 7pm and it was already dark and freezing outside.  The crowed of dudes that were hanging out outside were arguing about something very loudly and I did not feel safe thinking jt would either end in a fight or a shooting.    I realized its not a good idea to look at my watch or my new iphone because I wasnt wearing my bullet proof vest.

There was no wait but there was still a good crowd! Old people, young people, families, and couples on dates!

We were seated immediately via a friendly host & our server came promptly. She had great suggestions for drinks and food and we promptly put in an appetizer order for deviled eggs, and the shoestring fries! 

My friends told me the deviled eggs were delicious, disclaimer: I do not eat this. And we all shared the shoestring fries! They poured the Chinese mustard sauce all over them and it was a little too spicy for my liking. Which means it probably wouldn't be spicy for the average folk, but I'm a wimp! So because this was drizzled all over the potatoes I had a hard time finding dry untainted potato strings. 

For our entrées my friend got the famous burger, and he said it was cooked really well and delicious! He even loved his pickle. My friend got the naked chicken burrito bowl and asked for extra tortillas with it, and our server came over with some! It was a lot of food so she took the rest of it home! I tasted it and it definitely had great seasoning and cilantro! 

My girlfriend got the Brussels sprouts and the chicken dumplings. The brussels sprouts are a highlight of this menu! They are served at a great temperature, browned to perfection, drizzled in sautéed pomegranate seeds and yogurt! It sounds like it wouldn't be good, but trust me it is an absolutely amazing flavor profile! Try it!

I ordered the jumbo lump crab pad Thai and the flavor was phenomenal in this too!

The chef has a great mix of spices and flavors and I was really impressed with how each dish brought out that cuisines distinct details. 

And if you like mint ice cream, the grasshopper pie was split between the four of us as an awesome dessert!! 

Bonus of the night, Jason Seagal was there!

But outside of the screens: honeygrow is kind of expensive for teeny portions and pretty subpar food.

I got the spicy garlic egg noodles, sub tofu. The sauce was pretty off: tangy, sour and sweet - all flavor profiles I love! - but somehow tasted wrong all together. There was a strong smoky taste present: probably from the crunchy bits of burnt tofu tossed throughout. The vegetables still snapped like they were raw. There were practically oil slicks where my container sat. 

For $11.95 and about a medium Chinese takeout container's worth of food, it didn't seem worth it. I'm also watching my calories pretty carefully, and was bummed to waste nearly a day's worth of them on a fistful of blah-tasting stir-fry.

We shared bluefish croquettes and matzo ball tamales for appetizers. The croquettes are your usual stuffed, breaded croquettes so I wasn't particularly impressed. The matzo ball tamales though, are very good, in presentation and taste.

We visited on a Saturday afternoon, and enjoyed a super chill, quiet lunch. I imagine that the experience would be totally different and much rowdier during peak times, such as happy hour (speaking of, they have great happy hour specials!).

Several of the options, like mac/cheese and their smoked chicken, are only available in the afternoon/evening. So just be aware of that if you do go for lunch.

You go through a line, order some meat by the pound, pick your sides, and pay. Then you shuffle over to the bar and pick your poison of choice (they feature whiskey and draft beer).

We chowed down on brisket, hot links, broccoli salad, and baked beans. The food was excellent and strongly reminiscent of our beloved home state. The brisket was not quite on par with what we get in Texas, but it is definitely the closest that we've found here. Read: really freaking good. However, the baked beans and the smoked Italian hot links were the highlights of the meal. The beans are smokey, sweet, and full of tender, delicious ""burnt end"" meat. So good! 

The broccoli salad is also a great, light, fresh choice. It's super crunchy, with lots of garlic, citrus, and vinegar. Serves as a good counterpoint to all that juicy, unctuous meat.

Overall, we're stoked to finally find some quality 'Q here in the city. Check it out!

Every time I go to the Reading Terminal Market, I keep browsing, and most of the time, I end up getting something from Beck's Cajun Cafe. It has to be my absolute favorite.

I believe I have tried just about every delicious item on their menu, except the Train Wreck and the Gator. Two legit reasons : The Train Wreck has pork and I don't eat it, and and about that Gator...I can't eat something that could have eaten me in different circumstances!!!  Otherwise, I was happy with every item I have had, and usually a nap would be needed.  

- Heavenly beignets, served four days a week, made to order. Oh boy! 
- Rich and creamy Blackened Chicken Alfredo, with a spicy kick.
- Fancy some Shrimp and Chicken Gumbo? Mind-blewing! 
- Pepper, eggs with provolone breakfast wrap. Its good.
- Blackened Chicken Po' Boy. Not my fav.
- Don't miss the Fried shrimps.  Uh, yeah.
- Fried mac n' cheese balls, they were a little bland and not as good as they sound. 
- Craving king cake, Beck's serves it during Mardi Gras season. I had it for my birthday! Oh, so good...
- Golden Sweet Cornbread. I usually don't like cornbread, but this one is so sweet and moist. 
- Bread Pudding. Okish!

Beck's Cajun Cafe staff is extremely friendly. They always greet everyone with a huge smile, and offer samples of their food. 

Want to try some of spice blends from Beck's pantry? Take some home, they have several: Devil Dust, Angel's Kiss, Rub-a-Dub, Creole Mayo, BBQ Onion Relish and 3 Devils Hot Sauce.

Garces is an extraordinary chef and to keep a place that big humming the way it does while keeping the food quality so high is the mark of an excellent manager also.  Had a lovely time as always, sharing the food among the four of us is always a lot of fun.  Our waiter was charming, enthusiastic and knowledgeable, pushing the food but in a gentle way.  After about 15 dishes, we remembered that we hadn't received our cheese plate, we decided that we were quite full and asked the waiter to cancel it.  Here's where Dr. Jekyll became Mr. Hyde, or is it the other way round? He said cancel it?  What am I going to do with it? OK he said, I'll just have the chef throw it in the garbage.  I couldn't believe my ears.  First I answered, if you have a chef who will throw away a cheese plate, he needs to be fired.  And secondly, with over 200 guests ordering, if you can't sell that dish within the next 20 minutes it needs to be taken off the menu..

The space is small and very loud so be prepared if you've never been. The service was somewhat of a team concept but we had one main server. Everyone was professional but friendly and knowledgeable-excellent. The food is a take on modern Jewish cuisine. 

I had the tomato salad to start. This had great flavor with pumpernickel croutons and pine nuts. The broccoli and cheddar kugel was my second choice. Again good flavor and interesting since I've never had savory kugel before.  This was somewhat like a quiche. Lastly I had the corn kreplach with kale and mushrooms. The server asked about dietary needs and when I told her I was vegetarian she told me she would have the kitchen make any necessary changes to the dishes. Much appreciated. All were very good and unique.  For dessert I had the chimney bread which is little cinnamon sugar bread with pistachio and mascarpone cheese.. yummy!

The sabich includes some eggplant and a hard-boiled egg... it makes my heart sing. They've even got whole wheat pitas for those being extra health-conscious (it's already Kosher, so you've got one star in the health department going in).

We got takeout here for the second time last night, ordered entirely different items to get a sense of their range, and everything we got was incredible. This time when I got to the place to pick it up there were no hiccups with our order and it was ready promptly. I met the owner, Ben, who was very personable and genuine. I'm rooting for these folks, they've got a good thing going here! Also, they will have their liquor license this weekend and will be serving at their bar by Monday. The bar is really cool, backlit marble. 

When the order was ready I asked for a separate bag for the blue crab avocado salad, so as not to have it get hot in there with everything else. So glad I did! That thing was a masterpiece. A half of a perfect, ripe avocado filled with heaps of perfect crab salad with a spicy kick, and fresh greens with a lovely vinaigrette. E demolished it.

I went for the thai basil style chicken, no onion no garlic, spicy. I ate almost the whole thing (good thing this was after the gym!). The sauce was so flavourful and it was packed with tender, moist chicken and string beans and peppers. I want it again right now even though it's 8am. E got the shrimp pad thai, mild, and it was pad thai perfection. The noodles were firm and springy with a light tamarind and peanut sauce and all the right fixins. He wasn't crazy about the pickled radish bits but I liked them. 

The shrimp alone are worth a shout-out: huge, well-cleaned, perfectly cooked, and 7 to an order of pad thai. The tails were left on but pulled off with ease. I stole one, and a bite of the noodles. Then some more of the noodles later with bites of my chicken. I kept going back to the kitchen after I cleared the food to snack on cold leftovers.

Although we weren't here for the famed brunch, but for dinner, we ended up ordering off the ever-changing themed brunch menu, which is a few bucks cheaper than the dinner menu. After staring at the menu for what seemed like hours (it's a tough choice with so much to choose from!), we finally decided on the Old Bay shrimp sandwich and the fish tacos (sorry, can't remember the cute names they were given). As an appetizer, we also chose the soup du jour, which was spinach and lentil, heavy on the lentil flavor (meaning you might want to salt it up a bit). 

The sandwich: The Sarcone's roll is kind of difficult to bite through, so you have to kind of yank on it with your teeth, usually resulting in all the filling being pulled out. The fish tacos had tilapia, diced tomatoes, guacamole, chipotle sour cream (delicious!), spicy salsa (also yummy!), and double-wrapped corn tortillas (nice attention to detail, since corn tortillas tend to fall apart quite easily). The fish tacos reminded me of Baja Fresh, actually (which is not a bad thing!). On both the sandwich plate and the tacos, the same coleslaw was used. While it didn't really matter for the taco, as a separate side dish on the sandwich plate, it could have been marinated for a bit longer. Solid, delicious food, some nice attention to detail.

It WAS Saturday night, but for a place that's famous for its brunch, it was packed! The waiters were obviously very busy, and so was the kitchen, so the slow service was understandable, although quite torturous for my hungry belly. Should have brought a bottle of wine! When the food came, we rejoiced and were merry, positively gobbling everything up. Everyone was very friendly, too! The whole ambiance of the place feels like you're eating in someone's dining room, cozy and comfortable.

A broken smart phone is about as ""smart"" as that one person who's still hoping to make his fortune on beanie babies. A broken engine turns your car into just another expensive place to store things like old magazines and sweaters you aren't going to wear. A broken spirit loses wars, and a broken heart results in the overproduction of cringe-worthy ""emo"" music.

...but broken rice? Broken rice is an entirely different story.

With each segment that the individual grains are broken into, the light flavors are able to seep in more delicately, providing a palatable texture, almost like a sexy, Vietnamese take on cous cous. Broken rice is so much more than ""just rice,"" and Nam Phuong has the best in the entire city. I think about it often. Almost as often as ""Call Me Maybe"" gets stuck in my head. Broken rice dishes are accompanied by expertly grilled meats, with a salad of pickled veggies and a splash of fish sauce to top it off.

I shouldn't be too surprised since I've had similar experiences in other bars that Leigh Maida and Brendan Hartranft have opened like Local 44, Strangelove's, and the gone too soon Resurrection Ale House. But Memphis is the place that started it all for them, and the less traveled for me since it's always the furthest away from where I've lived. But every time I'm in the area I visit and discover something new that adds on to their greatness!

During my first visit I enjoyed their amazing happy hour which featured discounted drafts, and solid food bites like their trio of incredible deviled eggs. On top of that it gave me my first preview of their incredible beer list which regularly features the likes of Captain Lawrence, Tired Hands, Tonewood, and a ton of rare beer releases.

during my next visit I was able to grab a fuller sample of their menu options, which includes a ton of vegetarian and vegan options that rival most meat ones. the roasted mushroom grinder is a delicious mix of sharp provolone, garlic mayo, and cherry peppers. add in other options like a quinoa chickpea burger with smoked coconut and harissa mayo, and old bay jackfruit cakes with pineapple salsa, and veggies shine throughout. But carnivores will also enjoy the Mighty Memphis Burger with aged cheddar and fried kielbasa, or chicken fried chicken with mac and cheese and habanero mustad sauce.

Toss in a consistent mix of awesome beer events, and a kick ass outdoor beer garden when the weather is warm, and there's plenty to enjoy!",2019-05-24 04:04:42,Memphis Taproom,2331 E Cumberland St,Philadelphia,PA,19125,39.9803676,-75.1230344,4.0,675.0,1.0,"{'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""'full_bar'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'CoatCheck': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': None, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': True, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}"", 'BYOB': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'GoodForDancing': 'False'}","Bars, Restaurants, American (New), Beer Bar, Pubs, Nightlife","{'Wednesday': '11:30-0:0', 'Thursday': '11:30-0:0', 'Friday': '11:30-0:0', 'Saturday': '11:30-0:0', 'Sunday': '11:30-22:0'}"

also, the videos for the songs are absolutely hysterical. one featured a girl in spandex biker shorts doing the runningman while people rollerbladed around her... i loved this.

We were really only interested in trying the ramen so we ordered both the miso and brisket bowls. To me, a bowl of ramen is judged by its broth and meat, and both bowls hit home runs in that department. The miso bowl was very rich and flavorful, while the brisket bowl was more spicy with a kick of kimchi. The brisket bowl came with a matzah ball, which I found strange... I didn't care much for it, but it did soak up the broth fairly well. The eggs they put in both bowls were really soft.. like not just runny yolk, but runny erythang..

Not that my meal was awful or anything, it was good.

The bone marrow appetizer was good, but not nearly as good as others in the city have been (Meme), and its presentation was lifeless (as was the fish and chips special).

The menu wasn't very extensive, but it still took me awhile to decide what to get because nothing was screaming out to me. I ended up getting lox and eggs, which tasted bland. It came with multi grain toast with no butter, no cream cheese, no jelly... just plain toast. The poor presentation did not help in any way. For such a well known restaurant, shouldn't the meal be somewhat eye appealing?

The ambiance was pretty, but I was really disappointed with the customer service. I got there before my friends and asked for a table for 4. My friend brought her 6 month old along as a surprise since we hadn't yet met him. Little did we know, the restaurant would cause a stink about having to find a table for 5 instead. It was astonishing that this was such a big deal when they weren't even that busy. All they had to do was push a small table next to our original table for 4 and provide a high chair.

Whatever kinds of cocktails you like, there will be something for your taste.  If it's not on the menu, they will still make it really well.  I had a few whiskey cocktails that were not on the menu and they were very, very good.  Everyone else was trying out different cocktails all over the menu and everyone seemed to be very happy with what they got.
Where I think there is a little bit of a problem is with the food menu.  The things that we had were inconsistent and some things were just not very good at all.  The duck and foie gras flatbread was very good, but I think everything else we had was fairly mediocre.  The tuna tartare had no flavor at all.  No one really wanted to finish the chorizo flatbread.  The juices and sauces for the oysters were all kind of odd and didn't go with the very salty and very stringy oysters.   The buffalo chicken croquettes were not very good and had an odd flavor with a really strange consistency.  I'm fairly sure that the waiter did not properly identify most of the cheeses on the cheese plate, but they were mostly ok.  The grilled mergez was not very good, not very spicy and was mostly just covered with sauteed peppers.  The grilled octopus was not very interesting did not have a very pleasant flavor.  The calamari, however was pretty good and had a nice accompanying sauce.

This Saturday, though, I DO remember. We started with the ""spicy crispy calamari"" with goat cheese, spicy cherry peppers, and arugula as well as the lobster bisque. The calamari was the best tasting I've ever had. It was perfectly spicy and the goat cheese was a great compliment to it. I do wish the calamari was a little more crispy than it was, but it still tasted amazing. The lobster bisque also was declicious. We each were swapping our apps back and forth to one another until there was nothing left :(

For dinner I got the lamb chop with swiss chard and roasted potatoes. It came with a red wine sauce and the plate was circled in a pesto sauce. It was really good. The best bites were the ones where I got a little bit of everything on the plate on my fork and ate it all at once. My man got the sea urchin pasta. The pasta was black with squid ink and was complimented with sea urchin and crab meat. I wasn't a huge fan of the dish, just because it kind of creeped me out, but it didn't taste bad or anything. It tasted, to me, like the ocean - salty! He loved it, though. And now he gets to say that he's had sea urchin, which was the main reason he chose the dish.

For dessert I got the nutella crepes. I was disappointed, mostly because I love Beau Monde's nutella crepes, and they're really not the same. The ones at Positano Coast were stuffed with nutella, raspberries, and hazelnuts. I didn't like the nuts. The side of ice cream was chocolate with more nuts. Meh. My husband got the dulce du leche gelato, which came in a mini-waffle bowl. That, I must say, was very good.

Overall the meal was delicious. We had planned on staying for the open bar that went from 9:30 pm - 2 am, leaving in between to watch the fireworks, but we never went back after the fireworks.

This large, multilevel venue hosts live music acts, several bars, and a restaurant. The upper floors provide a fantastic, unobstructed view of the stage. This place has a dining room, streetside seating, and pool tables - it's hard not to like their hip jeans-and-t-shirt atmosphere.

Friends and I had tickets to see Battles. The show was sold out and it was a full house. While we waited to be let upstairs, we shared a plate of oysters which weren't the coldest, but the sauce was perfect. (Their menu changes often: I saw finger foods and larger entrees. Hungry? There's plenty of time to order; their kitchen closes at 1 AM.)

Four bartenders helped us that evening:
- the first seemed impatient, as if she had a big ol' stick up her butt. When I asked for shots of ""anything creative"", she wasn't receptive, insisting I pick something. I said ""kamikazes"", and thankfully she made the smoothest I've had in awhile.
- the second bartender was okay. I requested the strongest liquor they had, and with a little uncertainty, she came back with shots of Wild Turkey.
- third time's a charm! Aileen was friendly, smiled, and (after asking for creative shots) made us a delicious concoction involving Crown Royal, Myers, Malibu rum, and pineapple juice. Best of all, she gave me faith that not all the bartenders here were duds.
- Anne was welcoming, getting us shots of Jagermeister without issue.

The show itself was an experience. I enjoyed Thank You's - the opener, from Baltimore - trippy tunes, thanks to the venue's powerful, almost overwhelming, acoustics. I liked their music but the crowd seemed polite, at best. (C'mon Philly, show some love!) More enthusiasm was shown for Battles, everyone rocking to the beat.

Atmosphere: Dimly lit, quite intimate, and good for smaller groups. Getting reservations of parties over 6 is pretty much impossible unless you call really in advance (2+ months). Service was amazing though.

Food: Toasts are a great choice, especially the scallop & truffle butter - my personal favorite. I also really enjoyed the veal chop, and surprisingly, the choi farci - I've never had stuffed cabbage, but the creamy sauce really made the difference.

Do not try: We really did not like the chicken liver tortellini, which is off the menu now. The tortellini was way too hard / tasted undercooked. Honestly, we should've sent it back to the kitchen. This is what disappointed my boyfriend the most - for how much you're paying, the bar is set really high, and this dish was not satisfying at all. Do not recommend this.

Turning northward the next stop on my agenda would be a proper breakfast at Sabrina's Café.  Arriving shortly after 9am on a Wednesday I was spared the famous excessive line and was given the option of seating outdoors or inside - with 70 degree weather, a nice breeze, and the active Italian Market just to my East I decided to sit outdoors in the shade.  Greeted by an impressively attentive young female server I ordered coffee (a rather standard blend which was filled instantly and repeatedly) and browsed the menu for a few moments - identifying two items that sounded excellent I inquired if half orders were acceptable and when I was assured it was I opted for a half order of each.

Seated, sipping my coffee, and browsing my maps I waited for approximately 20 minutes before my options would arrive - and arrive they did, excessive in both size and presentation.  Long winded in words and ingredients, my first selection would be the Killer Quasar Stuffed French Toast with Challah, Stuffed with Mascarpone, Blueberry and Vanilla Crunch, Topped with Peach-Vanilla Syrup and Seasonal Berries...and to be honest, it was Killer.  Almost a bread pudding in consistency the buttery Challah was crispy outside and custard like within while the mascarpone lent its characteristic flavor and texture.  Breaking up the smoothness were fresh strawberries and crunchy bits of blueberry granola and the whole dish was topped with a ""syrup"" that was more akin to a compote of pureed peaches.

The second choice, Magnificent Magnetar Pancakes with Buttermilk Cakes Topped with Polenta-Orange Cake Crumble, Dried Apricots, Orange-Honey Berry Compote, and Walnut-Orange B utter was good, but certainly not as great as the French Toast.  Again using an amalgam of summer textures and flavors I will definitely note that the flavors were outstanding and well thought out despite the multitude of ingredients.  What was lacking in these cakes, however, was the pancakes themselves - doughy, thick, and uninspiring on their own - I actually left the lower pancake on the plate after consuming the entirety of the top pancake and all its toppings.

Paying the modest tab and leaving a sizable tip (the service was much better than it needed to be, something uncommon for a ""hip"" restaurant) I made my way back to the market for more browsing before turning north en route for the Mutter museum.

The drink menu was large, but we both opted for a dirty martini. Unfortunately, these were so salty they were almost undrinkable. After that, we stuck with draft rose cider, which was much better. The food was all delicious. We had pulled mozz with figs and fried capers (so good, the salty crunch of the capers pairs well), herbed rosti fries (get these, they are like a square form of a crispy potato latke), roasted heirloom carrots, heirloom tomato toast, and truffle flatbread. The toast comes with only 3 pieces, so be aware if you are splitting. We were full and very satisfied with those 5 things. My favorites were the first two I mentioned and the truffle flatbread.

Sunday morning is synonymous with what for me?  Brunch, of course!  Having heard a lot about Sabrina's Cafe in Philadelphia, and seeing their new location on the Drexel Campus near by, I had to head over.  So I rounded up the gang and hit it up a few weeks ago.

Sabrina's has somewhat of an ardent fan following in Philadelphia.  They have a few other locations around the city, all of which are really recommended for the food.  And they are absolutely right!  The vegetable spring rolls, the barking chihuahua (a burrito, just to be clear), and the eggs benedict all come recommended from my own experiences here.  The veggie spring rolls (not something you'd expect in a place like this) are fresh, flavorful, and a great addition to their menu.  The barking chihuahua, a behemoth burrito (somewhat interesting name, if you think about it), is filled with eggs, beans, peppers, cheese, and just about anything else that you want in it.  Eggs benedict is also done well here, albeit the hollandaise is a bit too eggy per my liking (a common issue).

On the other hand, while the stuffed french toasts are loved by some, my friends (and I) all agreed that they seemed to be a bit too sweet for our liking.  If sweet stuff floats your boat, by all means go for it!

Stuff is reasonably priced, although a group of 3-4 can easily rack up a 60-70 dollar bill without much trouble.  Still, for the most part, considering the quality of the food, it isn't too bad.  But a glass of OJ can run you 4 bucks!  Bit high for a campus dining option, if you ask me.

Service was decent.  There was an hour-long wait for a party of 4 (we got there at noon, so not unexpected).  Our server was nice, but as some other folks also remarked, the check was brought out shortly after the mains arrived.  I definitely understand that you need to turn the tables, but still... really?  Also, the server seemed to be forgetting our table for 10-15 minutes on end.  I don't really want you breathing down my back, but I would like water every now and then... y'know?

All in all, a decent place, and I have been back since my initial visit.

It's dark and loud like every other Marcie Turney restaurant, but Barbuzzo by far has the best service out of them all. Sure there was a slight wait for the pizza, but it was like the drinks magically appeared right after you ordered them! 

As an appetizer, we had the Sheep's Milk Ricotta. It was creamy and light and came with grilled bread and balsamic. It was a great start and was not overbearing like your regular old ricotta.

We shared the Margherita Pizza and the Maiale Pizza. They're wood-fired, have a thin, soft middle and a light and flaky crust. They were very good. The crust wasn't burnt like I've had elsewhere with wood-fired pizza. The Maiale was oddly devoid of prosciutto and pancetta and was mostly garlic broccoli rabe despite being basically the Margherita Pizza with the aforementioned three ingredients for $4 more than the Margherita. It was very good and I'm glad we got it, but it was basically a broccoli rabe pizza with a little prosciutto and pancetta. I might order it again, but that's because I love broccoli rabe so much. 

I, who eats more than my cohorts, also had the Grilled Porterhouse Lamb Chops. They were divine! They were larger and not overcooked like I've had at other small plate restaurants in the neighborhood (and I think cheaper, too)... The cucumber-feta salad it came with was wonderful as well. 

We all, of course, had the Salted Caramel Budino. It was wonderful, and I'm glad I waited so long to try it. I don't even think I can put it into words. You have to try it for yourselves. Even if you come here for the budino, you have to get it.

Don't even bother coming here on the weekend without a reservation. I watched at least 12 people leave after being told the wait was an hour and a half. Even at 10pm, the place was still full and had an hour wait. 

I can't say I'd wait months to make a reservation for a Friday night again, but I'd definitely come back during the week.

So this place has amazing infusions; Bacon vodka, jalepeno tequila, apple and spice whiskey. Did I lose you at bacon vodka? I'm a huge fan of the whiskey and I typically pair it with a Kenzinger...or whatever other beer I happen to be in the mood for. Don't shoot it though, sip it slowly like the sophisticate you are.

I like to go there on off-nights because I think the Rittenhouse crowd has started to flock here on weekends. Don't get me wrong, I love the Rittenhouse crowd...errr..

They have great Quizzo and feature a weekly line-up of other talent (The Olde City Sideshow for eg.). Oh and for brunch, you can make your own bloody mary. They give you a list of ingredients and you basically take your pick. Don't ask me though, I'm not a big fan of the stuff.

The interior and ambience is trying to be very trendy, chic, and lounge-y (which it might be for happy hour/dinner, I'm only basing it on my lunch.)

I've seen some other reviews mention similarities to Han Dynasty - which based on the cuisine/menu, is accurate and on point. 

The lunch menu has a bunch of great options, for a variety of tastes and spice preferences. I opted for the Cumin Style lunch special (but requested tofu instead of lamb or beef.) The waiter said they could accommodate my request, and it was exactly what I wanted. The tofu was crisp and loaded with cumin flavor and a nice level of spice. I opted for the Tom Yum soup as my appetizer, which was bright and tangy and a perfect warm-up from the winter cold.

Mercato opens up all their window-doors, and the noise of conversations, cooking, and the smell of good food hits the street.

The menu changes often, and they have original food for hearty and light pallettes, and some great bread to munch on with your salad. The chefs prepare things that are unique, you'll wish they'd have again when you return, but you'll be glad they're forcing you to try something else (if that makes sense).

It's a nice BYOB, and despite the fact that you're a few blocks removed from the bustle, you feel like you're in another city, or having one of those contemporary Italian dinners they have in the movies (not the stereotypical Soprano's crap).

Once last year and again during the pandemic while utilizing the outdoor dining option. I enjoyed my meal the first time, but the food has gone downhill since. The tables were socially distanced and everyone was wearing a mask. I went with a group of people so I've had quite a few brunch items to make a judgement call. On to the food. 

Brunch Specials - Chicken and Waffles, Brioche French Toast, Shakshuka, Shrimp Po Boy Benedict, Side potatoes, American Breakfast special, Fried chicken biscuit, Cheese Curds

The good- The cheese curds are DELICIOUS! They are a must. The French toast doesn't disappoint, it's thick, moist, and the toppings are great. It's a nice rendition of a classic dish. The shakshuka is also a solid option, the tomato sauce is flavorful, and the many veggies and legumes go well together

The ok- The Shrimp Po Boy had some good and bad components. The hollandaise sauce, biscuit, pickles, and poached egg were delicious. The shrimp was tiny, breaded in cornmeal, and entirely too salty. I felt my blood pressure rising. It came with home fries and those were just SAD. No onions, peppers, and they were  overcooked, what a waste of a potato. The Biscuit from the chicken biscuit is good, but the chicken was entirely too dry.

The bad- The chicken and waffles weren't good. The chicken was so dry and tough it was hard to eat. The waffle was dry and overcooked, but surprisingly tasted better than it looked. The American breakfast was a miss. Once we saw that the andouille sausage was a fried patty, that was enough of an indicator.

At least the pouch drinks were pretty good, but they ran out of pouches :/ bummer.

Overall:
Cheese Curds 5/5
Brioche French Toast 5/5
Shakshuka 4/5
Chicken Biscuit Sandwich 3/5
Shrimp Po Boy 3/5
Chicken and Waffles 2/5
Side Potatoes 1/5
American Breakfast 2/5

Our server gave us a free taco to sample when we didn't know what one of the entrees was and it was so yummy we ended up getting it! We got a small family combo and it was a ton of food for 3 people. It comes with 2 choices of meat, toppings, and 2 soups. They even gave us extra tortillas for free when we ran out! 

Lamb was so tender, but the spicy pork really stole the spotlight. I loved the flavors and the freshness of the toppings really brought the tacos together. I ended up eating like 10 tacos I think- dying now but it was worth it. 

The horchata is also spectacular- I think that is what I remember the most. Perfect flavor and really helps to tone down the spice. 

At the end our server brought us some sweet tamales on the house and they were also delicious! Honestly such a great experience here that I will definitely be coming back.

Our service was awesome. My two girlfriends and I were loving our waiter. He was cracking jokes left and right. We also happened to be there 30 minutes before happy hour which he was nice enough to tell us, so obviously we ordered some martinis. They were $6 and well worth the price.

The food definitely lived up to the atmosphere...and I'd actually be willing to bestow the supreme honor of placing this in my top 5 restaurants in Philly list. 4.5 stars for sure. 

-Atmosphere: hip, cool, modern, young...great place for a date 
-Service: Attentive and friendly for the most part. The bartender made up for where the waiter was lacking. 
-Drinks: Mojitos were quite potent, and very tasty. The stick of sugarcane was a nice touch. 

Split pea soup- Interesting flavor. Salty, smokey, a little savory...this dish wasn't anything special, but it was (seemed) authentic and I liked it. I enjoyed diving for the pieces of ham at the bottom. I'd imagine that in between watching a baseball game and oppressing his people, Fidel would too. 

Vaca frita: This dish packed a punch...big time flavor explosion. The steak was flavorful and mouth-watering. It was crispy on the outside from being twice cooked, but retained its juiciness while easily being ripped apart. The tomato escabeche was delicious, sweet, and even a bit tangy. The black beans were hearty, and the rice and fresh avocado slices were the perfect bite-by-bite accompaniment. Portion was great too.  Overall, a well-balanced, masterful use of diverse flavors...this dish was really spot on. 

Pork chop: I was only willing to part with a few bites of Vaca frita which I exchanged for some of my friend's pork chop. Pork chops are usually something boring / something I would never order...but this one was cooked to perfection, had a nice crispy sear, was well seasoned, and overall was delicious.  The moist congri rice and tasty orange marinade also helped in elevating the flavor. 

Vanilla rice pudding with passionfruit sauce: my friends weren't crazy about it (maybe because it had the consistency that was a cross between a soup and oatmeal), but I loved it. Original and simple- the flavors were light and refreshing but also satisfied my gigantic sweet tooth.

Each time I noted how small it was and that the crowd was full of energy.  Last night, the bar area was still full but I did carve out a small section of their 'standing' bar/counter area in the back.  I waited a few minutes looking at the menu before being approached by an incredibly friendly waitress that was very attentive and thoughtful.

As others have stated, the menu isn't huge, but it doesn't have to be either.  I was there for the burgers which I had heard were better than Rouge.  There are two options but honestly neither got me that excited because of what was on them.  I ended up getting their Village burger cooked medium without the thousand island dressing and adding avocado and white cheddar and also ordering the duck fat french fries.  It arrived, I sliced it open and it was cooked absolutely perfectly.  The bun was amazing, avocado fresh, and the meat wonderfully juicy.  It was incredible.

We looked to sit at the bar because there weren't any tables and she seemed annoyed that we wouldn't just wait. Although, we did end up waiting for a table in the end and it took about 10 minutes. Once seated, we grabbed some beers and had fries and scallops app and then salmon entree . The fries were delicious! Especially the sauce it comes with (on the side), and they are shoestring style. The scallops were good but not as great as I was hoping.

I'm pretty much ashamed of myself, but, in my defense, I had it in the back of my head that this place really sold out with the frozen stuff at the grocery store and when a location popped up in a mall in Delco.  I vowed I would never go because of these things...and I'm an idiot.

After an interesting night at Xfinity Live (aka Douchebag's Paradise), my boyfriend and I headed over to Tony Luke's before going home.  He ordered a chicken cutlet hoagie and fries; I ordered nothing (and later regretted it).  I had a bite of his sandwich and it was greasy heaven.  The roll was soft, the chicken cutlets were flavorful, and the overall hoagie was delicious.  If I had been completely sober, the amount of oil that fell out of this hoagie would probably make me feel ill, but thankfully the beer helped me get thru the couple of bites I took.

There were 4 of us and we split the following 10 dishes in no particular order: 

1. Pork bao buns - a must, but only come with 2 per order so ask for a knife to share! 
2. Korean Fried Chicken - good fried chicken but definitely tastes more like southern fried variety rather than Korean. Pickles apples on the side are crispy and spicy and I guess are the Korean addition to the dish
3. Kale and calamari salad - a big portion, great for sharing. The crispy calamari really compliment the lightly dressed kale and Julienned apples 
4. Chicken and pea shoot dumplings - tasty soup dumplings that unfortunately came towards the end of the meal so I didn't pay them much attention. 
5. Short ribs -might be my favorite dish of the night. Think tender juicy beef over a hot bed of spicy dan dan noodles. Yum!
6. Dan dan noodles - not the same as what was in the short ribs. They had the ground pork like I was expecting but there wasn't that chili oil kick that I was expecting after having trying these noodles at other establishments nearby 
7. Eggplant sate
8. Tuna sate
9. Duck fried rice
10. Crispy Brussels sprouts

Very spacious with lots of seating ( table and at the bar) so perfect for large groups. I went for happy hour and it was nice that the HH menu was available at the tables too.

We got a wine flight to share (can't remember but all red wines) and started off with a bread basket.

Our waiter was a mild mannered guy who was pleasant and accommodating. As usual the place was full to capacity with a wait but it was not exceptionally loud as it has been in the past when I dined here. Upon ordering drinks and returning with them we quickly ordered.

My guy got the buttermilk pancakes and fruit salad, with an assortment of melons......... Me, I got the crab and scallop quiche with 2 sides, mixed green salad and rosemary potatoes. Took about 15 minutes for our order to be ready for devour-ment (clearly not a real word).

Well, the waiter (who was not our waiter) brought the pancakes to the table as well as the side mixed green salad. As I was about to eat the salad he brings over the quiche with a small salad plated with it. So, I said ""Wow, the waiter didn't tell me there was a salad with the quiche or I wouldn't have order this one. In an unwarranted manner, way toooooooo much attitude and snarky, he said , ""Well did you ask him if a salad came with it?"" I looked at him in disbelief and my tongue was very close to a lashing of the tall brunette with a beard and mustache but I had to realize who was the server and who was the paying, vocal customer... No match... 

Since I was once a waitress, I always gave respect and always ensured if service is good I tip wait staff well because I know about the wages they make. Although ruffled, I realized this guy was not even my waiter. Once our waiter returned I advised him what happened. He was apologetic and stated he forgot to tell me it came with a salad since it was not written anywhere. I respected him telling me he forgot.  No harm, No foul. I tipped him well and left without complaining any higher.

But I have an memory like an elephant and if I ever return here and the bearded wonder is my waiter, he will not get one cent from me no matter how well his serve is. You get one chance to be rude to me,I don't do sloppy seconds.

The food overall was just okay on this visit. Quiche was somewhat dry with an overdone crust. Rosemary potatoes were slightly overcooked but edible. Maybe another visit may yield better results. Pancakes were good, large, light and airy.

The atmosphere is just like an authentic italian restaurant. The tables are close together and unless you're a hermit, it's almost impossible not to talk to the people next to you.

It's certainly a very, very neat place to go or especially take someone...until you get to the food.  Its just not all that good (& I've eaten dinner here twice now - the 2nd time only because I had a gift certificate).  The food is not really bad, at least none of my experiences were actually bad, its just really really not impressive or fantastic or memorable - especially for what you pay.  This place is WAY overpriced and in my opinion the menu is way too sparse as well.  If you go here because you think you're going to be treated to some great seafood, think again.  Trust me there are so so so many more places in Philadelphia you can go and see a larger menu with kitchens who turn out better food and the price will be comparable if not cheaper.  Off the top of my head if I think I want good seafood I remember my experiences at McCormick & Schmick at City Hall or Zesty's in Manayunk (this place is Mediterranean - YUM).  And if you really want that boat experience then head over to The Oceanaire Seafood Room in Washington Square. While it may not be my favorite place for seafood & you're not actually on the water its still way better than Moshulu (OMG their crabcakes!!) plus they pulled off the ""dining in a 1920's-40's luxury ocean liner"" theme very, very well.

Of the sides, my favorites were the mac 'n cheese, corn bread, and the baked beans. They also had macaroni salad, potato salad, coleslaw, collard greens, and mash potatoes. If I really wanted to, eating just the sides alone would've stuffed me!

Of the meats, my favorites were the baby back ribs, beef brisket, and pulled pork. They also had pulled chicken, shrimp, hickory smoked salmon, pork ribs, and some beef tenderolin? All I know is that there were A LOT of meat! 

Now to top off this ultimate comfort food menu, they had pretty good desserts too. Cookies, bread pudding, and ice cream. You really can't go wrong there (unless you ate too much like I did).

I'd definitely recommend checking it out. It's $18.95 + tax and buffet is from 5 - 8:30. They also accept credit cards.

We waited for our seats at the bar and ordered drinks. The bar is latin themed and the front bar area, while small, is cutely decorated with fancy tile and hanging plants. My mojito was small but delicious. 

We were seated shortly after our 8pm res time so they graciously brought us some guac on the house, very nice! The chips with the guac were a mix of what seems to be tortilla chips and some other veggie chips. 

We ordered about 4 additional dishes Jalapeno Rellenos, the Philly Steak empanadas, Smoked Poblano Slides, and the Traditional Tacos. I enjoyed all of these dishes but nothing really stood out about them. I think the traditional tacos were my favorite though! 

We finished with Tres Leches which was superb! Thinking about this slice of heaven now makes me mouth water. I think it had coconut on it, which I'm not normally a fan of but in the case I loved it!

Having sampled a large portion of the menu, it's rather difficult to decide between the numerous tasty options at Green Eggs, which is a very good thing.

Their savory items are standout. Most boast creative taste combinations, such as the varieties of benedicts with their unique riffs on hollandaise and perfectly poached eggs. There are numerous vegan options, such as the delicious tofu scramble, breakfast burrito, and vegan chorizo which isn't fooling any carnivores but is tasty in its own right. Even the simpler items, such as omelettes, are cooked skillfully and are seasoned well. They have Le Bus bread, bake great biscuits, and serve some of the best potatoes in the city, which all satisfy carb fixes quite heartily.

The sweets are very indulgent and can be a little overwhelming in terms of richness. Their fantastic creme brulee french toast and red velvet pancakes are worth ordering, but unless you're a serious dessert fanatic split an order of sweets with a friend to break up the onslaught of sweetness with something savory.

I am a fan of the decadent, creative takes on breakfast classics, but Green Eggs' dishes can be huge gut bombs.

After Marrakesh: ""I lube glodishshes cuse they sooooooo dleiciosau! Got gordfrhshes!""

If it wasn't clear, Marrakesh is one of my favorite group BYO places in Philly.

Their trio of Moroccan salads, by itself, is good enough to warrant a visit. Everything is served with giant pita that you scoop the food up with. You will eat ALL of the carrot, cucumber, and eggplant salads. Trust me. Then, there's the lemon roasted chicken, and the other one with crazy spicy sauce whose name I don't remember, but is also so kickass that I think I still have a boot print on my derriere from the last time I was here. They also have this savory sweet flake pastry omelette that I always think won't work, but it's surprisingly good. It's like if eggs and french toast did the little Goku fusion dance, and morphed into their final form. For dessert, fresh fruit and baklava. Delicious.

I tend to go with groups of 10-15 people. You know. THAT group. The one they tuck away in the corner because we ruin other people's dining experience with profanity and sassmouth.

A special occasion is a good excuse to go, and the staff will make a big deal out of it which will add to the charm of it all.

When you're seated, take a sip of your complementary prosecco, take a deep breath, and relax. This is a 2-hour slow-paced tasting experience. The portions are tiny, but there are a lot of them.

Look over the menu to be sure you're not going to get something you know you'll hate or miss out on something you know you'll love. But don't spend too much time on this process. Keep an open mind because you might be surprised to love something that didn't sound appealing. 

The price is steep, yes. But you're paying for quality ingredients, impeccable service, and combinations of flavors more interesting than spaghetti and jarred sauce. It's important to remember that taste is subjective, and no one can guarantee that you absolutely love every single thing. If you expect to have visions of the Virgin Mary with every bite because you're dropping $$$$, and you'll be disappointed with anything less, you might as well stay home and order a pizza.

It reminded me of a Mongolian grill, but your sitting down, not watching, there are more options, and it's not Mongolian.

The prices are a little high, considering how inexpensive good Chinese food can be. And, for someone not familiar, it's not so easy to know what many of these dishes taste like.

I ordered the 3 chicken. It was good, though the chicken was about as soft as chicken can be, almost doughy. And, it was not breaded! Weird, I know. Anyway, it tasted good, but lacked any veggies. A friend pointed out that since the set-up is family style, that it might work better if mixed with a veggie dish.

The hottest dish anyone got was a 5, and I am told that was pretty spicy. I can only imagine what a 10 is like. And no, I did not try the 5 dish. I'm just not balling like that.

I dont even know where to begin so i will start with the award winning 36 hour roasted lamb cooked in what i call beyond perfection. 

Let's start with the preparation: marinated in a pomegranate molasses for 12 hours....I could end this whole review there. Ok...after marinating its slow cooked for another 12 hours, marinated in more herbs and spices, THEN seared to a nice crispness on top and hit with the pomegranate sauce again. 
Words can't describe what raced through my mind when i took that first tender bite into the lamb..That bite made me want ro succeed more in life so i could eat like that more often.

FOOD:
BAKED PECORINO is a plate of gooey, cheesy goodness with a bit of a sharper taste. RICOTTA is a pretty standard ricotta dish but delicious nonetheless. BELGIAN WAFFLE WITH SEMIFREDDO is so delicious! I have never had semifreddo before and it is basically a stickier, creamier version of ice cream. The one that comes with the waffle is butter flavored, so if you spread it out, it is as if the waffle has butter and ice cream on it at the same time. If you are in the mood for something sweet, I definitely recommend this. If you are in more of a lunch mood, definitely go for one of the PASTAS - they are all hand-cut and very tasty (at least one person tried each one in my party). 

SERVICE:
This is probably the best service I have had at a restaurant ever. The waitresses were so nice and friendly and were great about explaining everything on the menus and giving recommendations. The first time I went, the baked pecorino was taking a bit longer than usual to come out so she just gave it to us on the house. Then when we were looking at the dessert menu, we mentioned to each other that we had wanted to try the olive oil cake but were too full to get it. Five minutes later, out comes the cake, also on the house! The second time I went, they gave us ricotta on the house as well. So considerate, and it made the dining experience all the better!

ATMOSPHERE:
Amis has a well-lit, airy, bright atmosphere. There are beautiful lamps made of little red bottles of cordial. My favorite part is the bakery counter, filled with scones and bread and open toward the restaurant. Behind the counter you can see into the kitchen, a nice touch.

If you are looking for a nice place to go to brunch, I definitely recommend Amis!",2015-03-27 16:52:28,Amis Trattoria,412 S 13th St,Philadelphia,PA,19147,39.9448680216,-75.1632501141,4.0,762.0,0.0,"{'BikeParking': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '3', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'BestNights': ""{'monday': True, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': False, 'wednesday': True, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}"", 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'Caters': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}""}","Wine Bars, Tapas/Small Plates, Nightlife, Restaurants, Italian, Cocktail Bars, Pizza, Bars","{'Monday': '17:0-23:0', 'Tuesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '17:0-22:0', 'Friday': '17:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '17:0-23:0', 'Sunday': '17:0-22:0'}"

Each course was better than the last, taking the diner through an experience of the best ways to prepare fish. 

With a name like Little Fish, you better be good at seafood and this place more than exceeded expectations. The menu was unique (included a special variety of salmon for New Zealand no one had ever heard of) and prepared something you see all the time (yellowtail) in a creative raw preparation. 

The experience differs from the ususal seafood joint as the entire restaurant dines at the same time. There are two timeslots on Sunday, 5 and 8. If you arrive 10 minutes late you will miss the first course. When I saw this on the website I thought maybe this was just a bluff but every customer arrived on time and ready to time.

This place adds a new twist to established dishes - keeping things fresh and your senses satiated!

It's located on one edge of Rittenhouse Park, so the location is great for any occasion - given the backdrop of the park, creates a great ambiance. Inside, it's got a Cuban motif, with small ceiling fans circling throughout, low lighting, open concept, and lots of wood fixtures. The main bar meets you as you step inside, and then the dining space is towards the right.

I had made a reservation using OpenTable, and when I arrived, our table was primed for seating - just the way I like to start a dinner!

We were seated squarely in the middle - so on the bright side, we had great visuals of people watching, but also found ourselves getting in the way if we shifted too much in one direction. You feel how close the quarters are when everyone is walking around you!

Once seated, the waitress offered us some drink options - I chose their latte drink with some almond milk. While our drinks arrived, we reviewed the menu options and settled on the buffalo cauliflower tacos and the ranchero bean dip (with chimichurri!)

The dishes were perfect for two and really well made! Great use of ingredients, and well developed flavors! It shows they really went to great lengths to build the dishes, not just replace meat elements with a vegetable. The dishes were hearty, satiable, and at the same time not heavy on the belly. 

Our waitress was great with our questions and came around plenty to check in on us. The staff was generally friendly and accommodating.

My friend, Dan, got me to try it one day and I was really impressed. They have a lunch special (""The Blue Demon Express"" [?]) which is a pretty good value for an upscale lunch: $15 for a drink (non-alcoholic), appetizer, and main course. 

Here is my advice on selecting your courses: the nachos are monstrous, the tacos are smallish, the torta (sandwich) is pretty substantial. Therefore, choose your courses carefully - if you get the nachos as a starter, you should probably go with the tacos for your second. Otherwise, you risk the dreaded post-lunch, I-don't-wanna-do-any-work, food coma. It is highly recommended that you not get the nachos AND the torta. I would refer to that pairing as the ""Death Wish.""

We were seated on the second floor, and it was pretty evident that they'll be doing movie nights, with a projector faced towards a large white-walled canvas. Nice!

Our server was great, and helped us order the appropriate amount of food for three people. We started with a round of drinks: the house white for me and Victory root beer for the guys. The root beer came out in frosty mugs and I was a little jealous, despite my nice glass of white. That root beer is worth every delicious calorie. 

We shared the blue cheese salad, with mixed greens and sweet pecans. It was nice! Personally, I think it would have really took off with some pears or even halved grapes in lieu of grape tomatoes. But either way, I'd definitely order it again. 

Three pizzas were delivered one after the other to our table. The margherita arrived first. When it was dropped off, I asked the runner if they had forgotten to cut the pie, and he said something about how they are serving pizzas in the authentic Italian style, meaning we are meant to cut our own. We each took to cutting up a pie with the knives that we had used for our salads. Hopefully, Nomad reconsiders this decision at some point. 

Out of the three pies, the margherita was surprisingly our least favorite. It was okay, but I think the basic concept of this pizza showed the flaws more than our fancier versions. The crust became soggy quickly and was exhaustively chewy. This was true for all of the pies, but the spicy sausage and the tartufo had so many great flavors in the toppings that it was less noticeable. 

Desserts were limited to a couple sorbets and a banana nutella pizza, which none of us were interested in at that point. I think some gelato or ice cream would be awesome. 

Again, this review was written on the third day of opening weekend. Nomad is a really nice spot for a first date, casual night out or cool place to grab a seat at the bar.

The atmosphere is a good one, especially on the patio, if the weather is nice. Fun, laid back, casual. 
However, the service was a like slow at times. 

We started off with a couple of margs, which were ok but kind of weak and sweet.

Our app, a tlayuda, was by far the highlight of the meal. It's basically a Mexican pizza. It has a delicious cornmeal-based crust that's crispy and crunchy on the edges but still tender under the toppings. We got the one with duck and sweet potato. Really, really good. 

The one other dish that stood out was the sweet plantains. Simple, but tasty AF. The crema and cojita give them an almost cheesecakey vibe. 

The rest of the meal (steak, nopales salad, sunchokes, tres leches) was fine, but kind of forgettable. 

The steak was an odd, thick rectangular shape that led to the center being almost raw. Plus, the chimichurri was sour and sharp with garlic and lime. The salad & 'chokes, fine, meh...

I would easily argue that this restaurant is one of the absolute crown jewels of Philly, and I luckily have been here once in person before COVID and then recently got takeout from here. I couldn't find my pictures from my in person experience so I'm taking advantage of my recent takeout experience to just sing my praises. Both times I ordered the tasting menu, and this time I ordered the tasting menu for two for delivery. The tasting menu comes with hummus, baba ganoush, and labneh with two huge pitas. For dessert, there's a blueberry ashta (milk pudding) and a ma'amoul, and chocolate and almond financier (both are soft crumbly delicious cookies). I also added on the kanafeh.

The main dishes I selected for the dinner for two was the lamb kebab (halabi) and the branzino (samke harra). Every single item was cooked and spiced to perfection and it really held up in the drive to my apartment. The heating instructions for the kanafeh were easy to follow and tasted great at home too, almost as good as being served it right at the restaurant. Suraya puts in extra love to their takeout experience by not only labeling everything, but also putting on small description stickers of what's in the dish you're having.

I absolutely love this restaurant, please do show them some love during these hard times and trust you'll have a great experience.

The original Continental is exactly what I am craving whenever I end up at Continental Midtown instead: it's got character, ambiance, and tasty food. Unless you're in desperate need of a roof deck, I suggest heading over to this Continental in Old City instead of it's Midtown counterpart.

For some reason, I don't know if its the setting or what, but I like the food here better than Midtown. I love the diner feel -- sitting on bar stools or in booths and being able to actually (sort of) see the cooks through the pass through.

This is a great people watching location if you can snag an outdoor seat on a warm day. Who doesn't love staring at the eclectic group of people that end up at the corner of 2nd and Market?

I have yet to come here for brunch, but hear good things. I tend to overlook this place for brunch because the prices really do seem too high.

The beer selection isn't too shabby, but the real reason you'd go here is for the cocktails. The Dean Martini cracks me up whenever someone orders it (I'm easily amused). They give you a book of matches and 1 lucky cigarette with your martini. Kitchy, but I love it. If martinis aren't your thing, the drink selection is extensive, I'm sure you'll find something to make you happy.

We split a few plates.

On the other hand, the chicken liver left a bit to be desired.  It oddly only came with three pieces of bread (vs. 4 with the whipped ricotta) - I would think four would be standard so that parties of two and four can be easily served, but whatever.

Unfortunately, in many places around the city it is almost like they want to kick you out. Not here. The girl who helped me was very nice. I felt very satisfied with the service.
Moving on to the donuts.. They had all flavors, except for 2 fancy donuts which I don't remember. So I got: cinnamon brown sugar, cookies and cream (classic) + eggnog, sugarplum, sticky toffee, frosty the donut (fancy).
First of all, the dough itself: yeah it is that good. The flavors?
I thought the cookies and cream donut was very similar to the cinnamon brown sugar, honestly. It is the same donut in a ""cookies and cream"" powder. I didn't get the cookies, just the sugar.  
The eggnog donut was the only one that ACTUALLY tasted different among the fancy ones. The sticky toffee and frosty (supposed to be vanilla and coconut) tasted similar. I mean, if you got a coconut piece in the frosty and a crunch on the sticky toffee you would notice the difference, but I think it is very subtle. The sugarplum donut was way too sweet for my taste, but it was so pretty (it is purple)!
Overall, I enjoyed the donuts. My favorite, hands down, was the cinnamon brown sugar, especially because it is made to order and you can have it warm, YUM! The dough is very good and it doesn't need much, honestly. 
I feel like the fact that the donuts are only coated, not filled, prevents them from having a unique flavor when it comes to the fancy ones. Does that make sense? I feel there are very subtle differences between them. But don't get me wrong, they are delicious! Federal donuts is worth the trip!

My wife and I went here for Valentine's Day this year. She really enjoys the Stephen Starr franchise, so I thought I would treat her to their flagship offering. While she absolutely loved it, I think that I enjoyed it as much as, if not more than, she did.

We went right after one of the huge snowstorms that hit Philadelphia this year, so we planned to valet park (so as to avoid snowbanking the car on the street or her ruining her shoes walking from a nearby garage). The valet parking was pretty steep at $24 (+tip), but it was worth it. Though, you should note that it is not in front of Barclay; it's down the block in front of Parc, so you will have to a walk a little.

Our waiter was extremely nice and knowledgeable. This was one of those time where the waiter actually adds to the overall experience of the restaurant. 

The food was nothing short of life-changing. We started with the chopped salad, which was a sort of enigma. All advertised ingredients - kalamata olives, hear of palm, tomato, etc. - along with the lettuce were chopped to homogeneous fractals. When consuming a forkful of said geometric shapes, you could taste each and every one of the ingredients - amazing. Also, I hate to admit this (don't judge me), but this was the first time I have ever had a dry-aged steak. I will not even attempt to describe the deliciousness of the 20oz ribeye. It was actually worth the $48 - seriously. (being extremely cheap, that is the highest praise coming from me).

My only minor quibble (see aforementioned note on my cheapness) was that the side dishes seemed to be unreasonably priced at $10 - for mashed potatoes or broccoli, etc.

Anyway, while the check was not slight, I will always remember the experience - which is really what you pay for, I think, at a restaurant like this.",2010-02-27 22:38:32,Barclay Prime,237 S 18th St,Philadelphia,PA,19103,39.9487096,-75.1708743,4.5,789.0,1.0,"{'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '4', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'BYOBCorkage': ""'no'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""'full_bar'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'dressy'"", 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': True, 'casual': False}"", 'Caters': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'BikeParking': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True'}","Steakhouses, Restaurants","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '17:0-22:0', 'Friday': '16:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '17:0-23:0', 'Sunday': '17:0-22:0'}"

Service: A+
The only problem that I had with the service was that our server actually asked how everything was a little TOO much. Over-zealously attentive is the only way I can describe it. 

Atmosphere: A 
If it hadn't been for the paddy-wagon parked outside with the lights a-blazing the entire time we were inside, the setting would have been tops. (Naked chicks floating amorously above me... I'm in.)

Food: B 
Ok, here is where we have some problems. The mac-n-cheese that is often touted as such glorious fare was (in my humble opinion) boring as f--k. Honestly, the flavors were much too mild for me to really appreciate.  
I asked the server what to order and she said that the chicken breast, which my friend had ordered, was the best thing on the menu. Well, we can't have two of the same at one table, so I ordered the veggie burger which I was told (again, by the server) was very good and made in-house. Here's the thing:  if you are going to call something a burger, it really needs to be in patty form. Period. This ""thing"" was total mush. The whole jawn fell apart as soon as I looked at it.

A few of us had been wanting to try Sampan for a while, and we figured RW was a good opportunity since they offer basically their regular tasting menu at a $10pp discount. What we did not realize is that all five of us would have to agree on plates for the entire table to share...oops!

After some deliberation, we landed on the following selections: edamame dumplings, General Tso soup dumplings, Korean BBQ beef satay, spicy mustard wings, Pekin duck, scallops, and duck fried rice. The clear standouts were the edamame dumplings and beef satay. Our group had mixed feelings on the soup dumplings; some really enjoyed tasting the General Tso flavor in a dumpling, but others wished the dumplings contained a little more soup. The Pekin duck was served with little bao buns, sliced veggies, and sauce so that we could make miniature sandwiches, which was fun. Dinner concluded with tiny ice cream cones - adorable and yummy!

I very much felt Sampan's vibe was best suited for a group or party - but the table next to ours was a couple celebrating their anniversary, so I suppose reasonable minds could differ. Bottles of wine and sake were pretty expensive, but individual glasses were reasonably priced (can never really understand why restaurants do that). I'd be curious to come back here at some point and eat at the bar; Sampan struck me as just the right mix of casual-yet-foodiefriendly that lends itself well to that.

We arrived at 5, put in our names for the bar seating and were seated at 6:30. (Not too bad, we went to khyber pass to grab a drink while we waited.) The food is excellent and very inspired. We had:

+ fried cauliflower 
+ salatim
+ grilled duck hearts
+ hummus
+ roasted rhubarb
+ a lamb meatball dish (don't remember the exact name)
+ pomegranate sorbet 

The cauliflower, hummus and roasted rhubarb were my favorite starters. I liked most of the salatim dips except for two of them; I recall that I didn't care for the super tomato-y one. We were waffling over the duck hearts and ultimately didn't order them, but the bartender/server brought us one gratis because he wanted us to try them. My boyfriend loved them but they weren't quite my thing; still, I'm glad I tasted them! The lamb dish and dessert were also great. There was a Turkish cotton candy on the sorbet...so perfect.

Well me and my stacked meat sandwiches were a revelation compared to the PB J's and 1 Slice of cheese sandwiches that I witnessed all around me in the cafeteria during lunchtime!
oh yeah, back to the review. I had the whitefish platter and finally tried out the Cel-Ray soda that my boyfriend had been raving about. The amount of food I received on my platter made 4 sandwiches.

Went with 3 other people and surprisingly, we only had to wait maybe 20 minutes (it was about 2:00 in the afternoon), though I can imagine that if we had gotten there at prime brunch hour, like noonish, it would have been a longer wait.

Service was on point, coffee was rich, OJ was fresh, place was sunny and cute and accommodated tons of hungover customers.  As for the food, it was everything I was hoping it would be, delicious and in large portions.  Ordered the steak and eggs and smothered it in tabasco sauce.  Steak was cooked perfectly but my only complaint is that it was a bit heavy on the peppers and onions.  Friend ordered the Kitchen Sink which was essentially every type of breakfast food stuffed into a giant skillet and smothered in cheese and some delicious sauce.  Very, very filling and heavy.  Tried the mac and cheese side and that was also very good.  You definitely get your money's worth here.  Everything's so hearty.

Menu was extensive so I'd love to come back and order my original gut choice, which was the  fried chicken and waffles benedict dish or perhaps try the breakfast burrito or some type of pancake variation.

Dropped it down a star for the lack of alcohol (it's BYOB).  When I'm hungover, all I crave is a bloody mary or a mimosa or an Irish coffee to accompany my meal.  Next time I'll do my research and come prepared with a bottle of something.

I went with a party of 4 (girls' night out), and we made the fantastic decision to do the chef's tasting menu. This basically means you can stop ordering and just let the waiter bring you dish after amazing dish, culminating in the mouth-watering lamb. (More on the lamb in a minute.)

I don't remember too many specifics of all the dishes that we had, but they were all amazing. The thing I remember most clearly is how incredible the hummus was. I haven't had hummus that good since I was in Israel. You'll want more, I promise.

Now, the lamb. Some of the best lamb I have had ever. It is brined for a day, braised for two days, then roasted for another day in a molasses and pomegranate marinade. It was FANTASTIC. Simply falling off the bone, no knives necessary. Amazingly flavorful. (Side note: the waiter told us the meat is braised at their sister restaurant, Percy Street BBQ, and after tasting the lamb we made it a priority to head over and try the meat there. Check out my review on that page as well.)

I would highly recommend this place for a special night out. Plan ahead, because it can be hard to get reservations (in my experience).

I've always loved their salads and pasta. It had been a while since my last meal there and I threw it out as an option for a weeknight dinner. 

My fiance and I each ordered a glass of red wine. Wines by the glass are very limited with regards to selection and cost around $8-$11. My glass of cab was pretty bad... but not as bad as my fiance's sangiovese. We shared an arugula salad which was nice, but priced steeply at $11 for what was essentially a plate of arugula, sun dried tomatoes and some parmesan. 

Both of us ordered basic pasta entrees; cheese ravioli for him and pasta bolognese for me. I requested wheat fettuccine and the dish arrived with wheat penne. I sent it back and our server came over to tell me that the only wheat pasta available was the penne. I opted for plain fettuccine, instead. I know in the past the pasta was always made fresh but I think things have changed. The portion sizes are still pretty large, and I had plenty for lunch the following day.

My friend and I had intentions on going to an Italian restaurant, but after a change of plans, we ended up here with an even larger group of friends! I had never heard of this place before nor had I tried German food before, but as my fine arts professor once said in college, ""It's never bad to try everything at least once!""

Because I wanted to try so much of the menu, my friend and I split two dishes. We split the Wiener Schnitzel (chicken) and the Schweinshaxe! Coming here made me realize how similar cuisines can be between cultures. The Wiener Schnitzel is a breaded chicken cutlet that came with fries on the side and it really reminded my of the Japanese katsus that I've had in many ramen eateries. The Schweinshaxe, which is Brauhaus Schmitz' specialty, is a crispy pork shank with a dunkel lager jus and wow was this delicious. For those of you who have had Filipino food, this is very similar to crispy pata, but of course with German flavors. Of the two, the Schweinshaxe was my favorite.

I did see that they had rooftop seating, which I will try the next time I get the chance. We were seated on the extended sidewalk, which was very loud at times, but bearable.

Appetizers:
We decided to order an order of escargot (my first time trying it) and the mushroom tart. The escargot reminded me of chewing into a mushroom soaked in garlic and butter. It was hard not to like, although it was too rich for me to eat more than two. The escargot came with some crostini as well. The mushroom tart was so flaky and delicious. I would order it again if I returned for another dinner. 
Entree:
I ordered the salmon Provençal which was a lovely piece of fish with a caramelized crust, lentils, and veggies. The flavors were well-balanced and I ate the whole dish happily. The portion was enough for one person to be full and satisfied.
My husband ordered the prime rib special. It came with horseradish and mashed potatoes.

today was one of those days where we were willing to wait the 45 minutes while our stomachs rumbled in anticipation of the meal to come. we passed the time by people watching and contemplating whether to go breakfast or lunch (seeing as it was 2pm), all the while growing more & more eager as other 2-tops being called had tired of the wait and left, making us that much closer to Next.
 
within moments of sitting down, we were handed menus and asked if we wanted coffee - yes, please! since enjoying the enfrijoladas so much on my last visit, i was set on ordering them again. this time instead of getting it made with tofu, i went for the vegan sausage. equally as delish. as if that wasn't enough food, i added a latke + [homemade] applesauce on the side for a mere $2.50. 

my boyfriend went the lunch route and ordered the brisket sandwich, topped with melted cheese & sauteed spinach, served with a side of horseradish sauce & fries. this led to me eating fries for the 3rd time this week (that's typically how many times i eat them in a month!) as i simply could not resist dipping them in the tangy horseradish sauce.

there are so many veg-friendly options at honey's that i sorta kick myself for getting the same one twice, but i fully intend to eat here enough to try everything [meatless] on the menu.

They also do a mixed grill for two which is really good, every meat on the platter is always cooked perfectly. Also, the potatoes are so delicious... I have no idea what they do to make potatoes taste so great but I am glad they do do it! If me and one other person go and split these two things the bill will be less than $50 and we'll have enough leftovers to make at least two more meals out of it. Really great value.

Ambience is pretty cool, you can sit outside if the weather is nice and it's right across from Eastern State Penitentiary so makes for a nice vibe.

I really like the atmosphere. It is kind of dark which is always a bummer when it's a bright, beautiful day out but I still really liked the look of the inside. They have high tops and low tops. We sat at a high top. It was a little odd that the table and chairs were the height that they were. We felt like the chairs either needed to be higher or the table slightly lower. We managed, though. 

Our server was excellent. He was very friendly and answered all of our questions. He was seating people, taking orders, going up and down for the food and serving drinks from the bar. There were other staff members but he was the star of the show at this particular time. Kudos to him! I'm so sad I can't remember his name!

They have DELICIOUS fountain soda! 

I checked out the menu on Yelp and decided I was going to get the French Dip. We get the menu at the restaurant...no French Dip! I asked the server if they used to have one and he said yes, it was so good and he missed it too. Such a letdown! I hate when people don't update their menus online. 

They did have some specials, though which we both ultimately decided on. I got the fish taco special which was made with Halibut and my Dad got the Ahi Tuna special served with cous cous. He thought  the Ahi entree was excellent. My fish tacos were good. The fish was fried. I felt they could have used a bit of sauce so I asked for limes. He brought me one lime slice for each taco which I appreciated and they did the trick! The tacos were served alone...no rice or beans. They were $19 which was a bit steep in my opinion. Both of these specials were served with an accompanying beer. That's awesome...if you like beer. I don't like or drink beer. My Dad is not a huge beer fan, either. The server said it was part of the price and the price didn't change if you didn't get the beer. That doesn't seem right to me. What if you are under 21...or pregnant...or a recovering alcoholic...or you just don't like beer?!?! I mean, I'll pay the $19 but I would rather have rice and beans than beer! 

We did not get dessert. 

The bathrooms are STRANGE! You walk back to the restroom area and you can go left or right. They are all unisex stalls. The doors go from top to bottom. There is a sink inside each stall. The toilet wouldn't flush. Not a fan of these bathrooms. They didn't seem super clean, either. Especially since we were what appeared to be the first customers of the day. It's bad enough when bathrooms aren't clean at the end of a long shift but at the beginning?!?! Why weren't they cleaner? I did appreciate the fact that there's a sink at the entryway to the bathroom. So if you just wanted to wash your hands before or after dining, you could do that. 

They do not accept Open Table reservations which always annoys me! It's 2017...join Open Table!

The house Dan Dan Noodles are very good, if a bit too soft. For what it's worth, I am still partial to Han Dynasty's rendition of the dish. Still, it's Jane G's other dishes which truly set it apart.

The Beef Lover's Quarrel is served cold and comes with beef tendon, shank, and tripe marinated in chili oil with peanuts and cilantro. YUM! Chewy, salty, spicy, and oh-so-savory. We ordered at spiciness level 4 -- it packs a punch, but if you like spice then I highly recommend it! If this doesn't sound appealing to you, maybe try ordering a Wawa sandwich on the next block instead.

Jane G's ""double cook fish"", however, was the real star of the show. Thick, tender fish, marinated, battered, and crispy-fried with leeks and soybeans, then topped with savory chili oil. Asian-style comfort food at its finest, and the large portions are definitely enough to share.

Unbelievably sad. Where does all the money go? I mean you make money from each customer but you don't really change or fix anything to the building nor the grill you cook on. Why make it so expensive for everyone?  Is it because of the competition across the street? At least I can see the changes that genos are making!

Make it cheaper!!! And smile when people order food, look people in the eye when they pay you an arm and leg for a small cheesesteak. It's just sad that for the fame and the past that such a place stays open. I am just disappointed.

So sooo worth it. I thought since it's a multi course thing for restaurant week the portions would be small but that couldn't be further from the truth.

We were tempted by the 4 course tasting menu they offer for $48 pp, but we do love to share plates and instead opted to have an appetizer, pasta dish and entree.

I would recommend splashing a little lime over the tacos because it was missing during my recent take-out.
I like hot and spicy food and Honest Tom's has a good set of sauces to go with their food. I really like their spicy taco sauce and jalapeño sauces.
Food's a little pricey, $6.50 for 2 tacos and ~$8 burritos..however the portion sizes are a little bigger than those in food trucks.

Perhaps it was because I'm a vegetarian, but we didn't get to partake in any amuses (although I noticed the table next to us had several). I was also surprised at how small the space was - cozy, perhaps a little too cozy, but very homey nonetheless.

The cauliflower flan attracted my attention for the rich egg yolk that spilled over the plate as soon as I cut into it, but it lacked seasoning and seemed slightly one-note.

I also had the sweet onion crepe, which was, as another review mentioned, reminiscent of french onion soup, except elevated by the taste of truffles - and the fact that it was delicious! Don't skip over this if you visit Vetri.

Continuing on the truffle theme, I loved the almond tortellini with truffles. More so, even, than the gnocchi. After reading so many Yelp reviews about how ethereal the spinach gnocchi was,  I felt it fell short in comparison to the tortellini, although it was delicious and incredibly light. The almond tortellini just offered another dimension of being more umami-rich, with the heavier application of truffle oil and cheeses.

I had the cheese plate for dessert. Going with the truffle theme, I enjoyed the truffle cheese the most. I would have appreciated more bread with the board. Overall, I don't think this justified the price point.

Vetri was a great experience, but after reading so many glowing review on Yelp, it fell a little short of my expectations.

But it ended up being a nice experience. So much that we went there twice in the same evening!  Once for dinner and once for a post auto show beverage.

We got there early, at 5, and the place was surprisingly low key. Of course there were some opening day festivities going on, but I'll skip all that and move on to the good stuff..

Staff: the staff was really nice and friendly!  They were totally awesome. All of them. Yay to you all for being so cheery and excited!  

Drink:  They have booze!  Wine, beer - however I didn't notice if they had the hard stuff?  But the beer and wine was reasonably priced. My only complaint was that none of the beers were local. Oh, and the tap system wasn't working yet..woops! 

Food:  Great menu.  With the only exception being a chicken hot dog, everyone had a burger and there wasn't a single complaint!  I can't say I'm a fan of hot dogs, but the chicken dog Chicago style was delish!  Try the urban fries, you won't regret it. And the onion rings were massive and delicious too.

Although Tony Luke's cheesesteak performed quite well overall, it received significantly lower ratings on two categories: aroma and visual appeal. The sandwich, although claiming one of the thickest cuts of meat, lost points due to the ""grayish"" shade of its fillings. Comments also point to its small size and overly tough roll.

Scoring a solid 7.0, Tony Luke's comes in at fifth overall - he just doesn't look good doing it.

I came last week with my SO, and my sister and her boyfriend. We wanted Mexican food and I don't eat animal products, and while most Mexican restaurants can make food vegan by just giving you rice and beans, we chose Cantina because it has dedicated vegan/vegetarian dishes. 

The Food: 
Overall the food was good, with some misses.
-Chip & Guacamole: good and very standard in flavor ($8) 
-Tofu & seitan fajitas which my SO and I shared: w/wild mushrooms, peppers, onions, black beans, white rice, pico de gallo, guacamole, and flour tortillas. The fajitas were GREAT and we were both really happy with our order, however it comes with too much guacamole and too little rice/beans/pico de gallo. It's also a decently sized portion so it was the perfect sharing size (just order more tortillas, rice, and beans). 
-Mushroom empanadas and esquites (corn): my sister is a big fan of taking the multiple appetizers as an entree route, and she said she was happy with her choices here. 
-Enchiladas suizas (chicken): This came out lukewarm, and my sister's boyfriend had to ask someone to heat it up. They took it without apologizing or asking further. When they did bring it back and he got to eat it warm, he wasn't into it. 

The Service:
Slow and at times nonexistent. 
-When out waitress first came to our table to ask about drinks and food everything seemed fine. She brought water and said she'd be back in a bit to ask about food. 
-When she came back to ask about food she forgot to ask about the specials, so none of us realized that there were specials until after we had placed out orders (we happened to spot the specials board). 
-Water was rarely refilled and when we made a request it would often take upwards of 15 minutes for anything to happen. As an example, my SO and I ordered more tortillas, rice, and beans. It took 20 minutes, by which point our dining partners had finished eating. 
-When we asked for dessert and the check, it took 20+ minutes for the dessert to come out, and when it did, the check was nowhere to be found. We again asked for the check, which was not brought out until I went up to someone in the kitchen and asked again. 

If they didn't have tons of vegan options (very clearly labeled with **) I wouldn't even consider returning given the service. That being said, if you are vegan I would still recommend coming if you want Mexican food (just don't expect much from the service).",2017-07-31 18:02:56,Cantina Dos Segundos,931 N 2nd St,Philadelphia,PA,19123,39.9648195,-75.1402322,4.0,904.0,1.0,"{'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'HasTV': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': None, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': None, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': False}"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'loud'"", 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}"", 'BYOB': 'False', 'CoatCheck': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': True, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'Corkage': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DriveThru': 'None'}","Nightlife, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch, Bars, Mexican","{'Monday': '17:0-23:0', 'Tuesday': '17:0-23:0', 'Wednesday': '17:0-23:0', 'Thursday': '17:0-23:0', 'Friday': '17:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-23:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-23:0'}"

My BF and I were craving Pizza the other night and we started to head towards Zavino. Barbuzzo is right next door and we wondered if we should try something new. So we inquired at Barbuzzo. It was very busy when I walked in but I saw two tables available outside so I went to ask the Hostess if we could sit there. I waited nearly 10 minutes for the hostess to come back to her station (that was a three star moment) no servers bothered to stop and say hi or help me or tell me the hostess would be back. When she finally arrived back she was very polite and nice. I asked if we could sit outside, she said absolutely, grabbed two menus and led us out there.

The Server:
After we were seated outside our server (Cassandra) was right behind us. Greeted us got us water and then explained menu impeccably. She was very friendly and had this super smile (I formed a teeny girl crush on her instantly and wanted to be her friend, she just seemed like one of those awesome people you want be friends with). She took our order we got the pototo pizza, and the margarhita, and a beer (which she recommended based on the pizza we  got) Server def. 5 stars!

The Food:
The potato pizza was amazing!!! 5 stars! The margherita was 3 stars. The amount of mozzerella was good. Perfect large melted circles. But barely any sauce, it had dried up or evaporated when they baked it or something. So I asked the food runner for a side of sauce and I dipped my pizza.

I would come back and try the pizza again and maybe just ask for more sauce.",2012-08-25 01:01:57,Barbuzzo,110 S 13th St,Philadelphia,PA,19107,39.950007,-75.1621577,4.5,2893.0,1.0,"{'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': None, 'latenight': None, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': None, 'romantic': None, 'divey': False, 'intimate': None, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': None}"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{u'valet': False, u'garage': True, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': False}""}","Mediterranean, Restaurants, Pizza, Italian","{'Monday': '17:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '17:0-23:0', 'Friday': '17:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '17:0-23:0', 'Sunday': '16:0-22:0'}"

A party of 5 arriving just after 5pm had no trouble getting a table. By the time we left around 7:30, it was crazy packed - but I think a lot of that was due to company holiday parties and probably is not normal. 

The hostess was nice enough to seat us way upstairs by the wine vault because there were a lot of large parties making the downstairs very crowded and noisy. All of the staff seemed very helpful and considerate, actually. The hostesses always checked to make sure you were following them, people came to clear away dishes even though you weren't their table... overall a nice friendly feel from everyone.

This particular location is housed in an old bank, so if you go downstairs when you first come in, you can see the huge vault door. Kind of cool for ambience. But at the same time - all of the marbled surfaces and high ceilings make for tons of echos - even at our table away from the parties I found myself shouting instead of talking by 6pm.

I ordered the Blackberry Ginger bourbon cocktail - quiiite delicious. I've had similar drinks elsewhere before though. My table decided to get a bunch of appetizers and ""sides"" and just go in family style. That worked out because I don't eat steak, but the appetizers and side choices all sounded great. I think my favorites were the cheesesteak dumplings and the lobster macaroni and cheese.

It is very expensive. It's a chain, and first and foremost a steakhouse, but it felt like we *and I mean, my boss* paid mostly for the scenery. The food was pretty good although I felt like the food that I ate was comparable to any other chain restaurant, just at twice the price.

Overall, a nice place if you like having fancy wine choices and I assume a good place to eat steak. I would probably come back to do some drinks/apps again if I was feeling like I had money burning a hole in my pocket. But I would highly recommend going to a local restaurant over this big chain if you want to go all out and spend $30/entree.",2015-12-17 02:47:33,Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse,1428-1432 Chestnut St,Philadelphia,PA,19102,39.9509564,-75.1654591,4.0,1129.0,1.0,"{'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'HasTV': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': True}"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'dressy'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '4', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': True, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': None, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'None', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'CoatCheck': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True'}","Food, Restaurants, Seafood, Specialty Food, Steakhouses, American (Traditional)","{'Monday': '17:0-21:0', 'Tuesday': '17:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '17:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '17:0-22:0', 'Friday': '17:0-0:0', 'Saturday': '15:0-20:0', 'Sunday': '16:0-21:0'}"

Amazing food + refreshing mojitos + expedient and friendly service + cool ambiance = make your reservation and go ASAP.

Here's some help if my ""everything"" recommendation is overwhelming:

Appetizer: empanadas, empanadas, empanadas. All four varieties (traditional beef, chicken/corn, pulled pork, shrimp). The chicken and pork are probably my favorite. Don't overlook the spinach salad and the tomatillo relish - the relish is one of the best accoutrements I've ever had on any dish. It compliments the empanadas so well.

Mains: Vaca Frita, Churrasco a la Cubano. Don't even ask questions. Just do it. Hint for the Vaca Frita - order a side of Maduros (fried sweet plantains), cut some up and throw them in the dish with the black beans.

Drink: mojito anniversario

Dessert: any of the Tres Leches they have at the time. By far my favorite type of dessert when done right, and Cuba Libre does it leaps and bounds beyond right.

And I lied - if there's anything you shouldn't get, it would be the gaucho platter for two. Not worth it.

Last night, my husband and I had a hankering for a cheese platter. After studying the menus for Talula's Garden and GTC, GTC won (not that we have anything against Talula's Garden; it's on our list of must-try places). 

Having been here multiple times before, we opted for a cheese platter, the chef's selection of charcuterie meats, potted duck, vichyssoise, and gazpacho.

We made our own cheese platter with the following:
- Fontina val d'acosta with lemon honey
- Piave vecchio with truffle lavender honey (this cheese reminded me of manchego almost...I got the same warm fuzzies in my belly after eating the first piece)
- Kunik with chocolate hazelnut sauce (our waiter also recommended the roasted garlic dulce de leche, which made me want to cry because I wanted both of them)

Since we're one step above cheese n00bz, we asked our waiter for accompaniment suggestions. He gave us a choice of two for each cheese, and all three pairings hit the spot. The fontina with the lemon honey was so good that we bought a 1/2 lb block and a jar of the honey after dinner (can't wait to snack on that later, hehe).

I didn't have too much of the meat plate. My husband concentrated on that while I tore into the potted duck-- foie gras mousse, duck rillette, and elderflower caramel, all smeared on toast. Holy what the, this stuff was incredibly delicious! 

We ended our meal with the vichyssoise, which we both love. I decided to try the gazpacho this time and sadly, I wasn't a fan. It had good flavor but there was something about it that I didn't quite like. Perhaps it was a bit too tart?

Nonetheless, it was one of the best meals we've ever had. Lots of flavor, our waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive, and it's definitely worthy of the 5 stars!

But we had been so good over the last two months that I finally caved and just HAD to eat sushi for dinner last weekend. I had noticed Bleu pop up on Yelp, so after a quick trip to Reading Terminal we headed over to their new little location.

We made it just in time to snag their lunch special (which they offer on the weekends!!), but the regular prices for sushi rolls are so cheap that it only makes sense if you want either soup or salad with your sushi (hehe, they gave us both!). We were the only ones there, so our order was quickly made and then came home and went in the fridge until later. That evening, warm miso soup filled my stomach and my husband munched on edamame. The sushi we ordered was tasty - eel avocado, spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and their special hot girls roll (Spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail inside w. avocado, caviar on top), and an order of the tuna dumplings (King crab, avocado, wasabi, tobiko, crunch fillings wrapped with thin tuna as skin with spicy citrus soy sauce). The tuna dumplings are tasty, but 1) are hard to eat with chopsticks and in one bite and 2) I thought that there was too much crunch in the filling (not spicy whatsoever, too). The regular rolls have 6 pieces of sushi, but a good amount of fish and not too much rice. The special roll was delicious, and definitely a favorite.

Philly Sabrina's, so we headed down there, ready for a wait. This cafe has a surprisingly long wait on Saturday and Sunday, be we arrived around 10:10, and were seated by 10:40. If you arrived between 10:30 and 11:30, however, you're likely to stand around an hour before you're ordering.

Looking at the menu, I was kind of baffled that there was this kind of wait. I go out to brunch often, and I couldn't understand why so many people keep showing up here. Because it was so busy, the service wasn't the best, but it was more than acceptable.

Lana custom made an omelet, and I ordered the barking chihuahua burrito. The coffee kept flowing while we waited for our food, and once it was delivered I knew why this spot was so popular. The food looked great, and between the two of us we had enough to feed a small family. Most of the dishes come with Sabrina's homefries, which are not to be missed. The food, overall, was excellent, and was definitely worth the wait.

I always order the fish dry pot with level 10 spicyness and it is delicious!! They bring the dish out in a pot with a candle underneath so your food will remain warm. The only downside to this is that the serving size is pretty small. 

The fish is cooked perfectly and it's so soft it basically melts in your mouth. They used to include a larger variation of vegetables with the fish but now it's mostly bamboo and mushroom that's edible. If you want to get the whole experience, I highly recommend getting the level 10 spicyness because you may tear up but the flavors are worth it. 

I have also tried the garlic sauce style tofu and chicken. It is just as good as it looks and they give a huge plate. It's basically bamboo, tofu/chicken, and mushrooms cooked in a thick reddish sauce. 

The chicken fried rice is better than most places and once again, it's a huge serving. It does have plenty of veggies and chicken.

This dish was a highlight from my recent takeout order and I can't wait to order it again. The perfect amount of sweet and savory flavors, tenderness, and garlic.

I was in the mood for soup so I ordered a beef noodle soup from Han Dynasty for pickup. While looking through the other menu options online, I noticed the Three Cup Chicken in the specials section. I decided to try it. Based on the way the menu describes the items, I could not tell if this was going to come with rice or not. I assumed (and hoped) it would, and it did. You just never know with takeout these days!

This place has been packed since its doors opened, and for good reason.  Seems like this area of town has been aching, begging for a place like Hip City Veg.  With its cute, modern interiors and with a menu that's sure to sate with all the comforting salad and sandwich options, all ""plant-based"" (aka vegan, why is that such a bad word anyhow?), what's not to love?  Yay. 

Options have been hit or miss, which I'm hoping (praying, is more like it) is due to the fact that the place is simply overwhelmed by the demand and the pace, and they simply have not been able to keep up or properly anticipate the challenges of getting the food made well, quickly and out the door.  I loved their Buffalo Bella, but found the Fajita wrap dry and bland, their salads lacking enough ingredients considering their conservative sizes - but on the whole, what they offer is good (which is why I'm torn here, three or four stars? argh! only time will tell!), I just think they need to get their place in order.  Speaking of order, the must order here, I must say is their Groothie (apple, leafy greens, banana)-- so yummy, I would down a gallon of the stuff if I could.  

So, yeah, if you're planning on taking a quick work lunch, this place will have you waiting, so avoid the lunch rush (at this place, it's pretty much 11:30 until 2, I would say) if you want to try it out,  wait with the hungry lots and order with abandon.

Now normally I would consider a restaurant within a half mile of my apartment close.  But not on this day. By the time I got there I was soaked in snow, sweat and icicles. In short, I had earned as many $5 wines/cocktails/martinis or $2.50 drafts that my heart desired.

Now when I hear ""free food"" and ""happy hour"" in the same breath, I generally think of some sort of bacteria-laden peanut, crunchy bar snack situation.  But not at Bistro Romano.  It was like a never ending Italian appetizer fest (okay so it ended after 5 of them, but who's counting when you're drinking $5 wines) brought out on individual plates, so that I didn't have to worry about my ravenous husband getting to all the good stuff before I did.  Calamari! Bruschetta! Mussels! And more!  And the best news is is that I was told this wasn't just a snow day thing and that I could literally do this EVERY happy hour and spare myself the agony of walking through the city in snowpocalypse!

Dumpling in hot oil was big hit, it was simple but had so much flavor in it. Scallion pancake was fried well and chewy, dipping sauce wasn't salty. Everyone seems excited about their dan Dan noodle but it didn't so much for me. Maybe I am not a big fan of noodle. 
I did enjoy mapo tofu, wasn't too greasy and enough spicy for me. Dry chicken was delicious but was too salty for me. I had few bite then couldn't touch more. 
Fish in clay pot had full of flavor but a bit greasy for me. Since most main dishes we ordered had powerful flavor, the fried rice was most popular dish on our table.

PSA: They take OpenTable reservations but only for parties under 6. It's actually pretty tough to get a res for 6 (they limited me to certain times) so you might need to cut some friends out of your life (or maybe just out of your dinner plans).

Service was awesome.  Our waiter (Benjamin) had great recommendations for everything from drink pairings to how many dishes to order and what not to skip and was not shy about telling us when he thought we made a bad choice.  

Drinks- didn't love the blinker (too sweet) and as my friend said they need to step up their ice game with big cubes if they're going to offer fancy cocktails like that. 

4 ladies with healthy appetites shared:
The Fried Cheese Curds.($8) Get them.  They're delicious and great to share and the dipping sauces don't hurt either. 

The Nashville buns: ($10) 2 per order.  Bite sized. Reminded me of Nashville in an awesome way (lil bit of a kick). Would come back just for these at happy hour ($3.50 instead of $5 each- pro tip: they also have a late night happy hour). Get them. 

The PuPu Platter. ($26) I'm a sucker for an appetizer sampler and this one had a lot of things: tuna poke, beef skewers, pork toast, shishito peppers, ribs, and wings. Large portions (more than 1 each), and everything was good, but nothing was mindblowing, and the wings were pretty ordinary.  I'd probably skip this. 

Short Rib Stroganoff. ($18) Maybe my favorite dish of the night. English peas, fresh pasta, tender meat. Get this. 

Sea scallops ($22) 3 large scallops layered with corn cakes and veggies.  Good but not great. Skip.

Local greens. We ordered a lot of unhealthy foods.  These were good to balance that out. Pleasant surprise and made us feel healthy. 

Funfetti cake. Massive and the fluffiest cake you will ever eat. Oddly topped with a fortuneless fortune cookie and surrounded by some strawberry thing that tasted like the inside of a pop tart. 

Apple donuts with chai cream cheese.  So good.  Must get these.

We were very full by the end and packed up half the desserts.  Prices were reasonable for how much food we got (with about 1 drink each it was $50).

Restaurant Week meal (each person chooses two first courses and two second courses each) went like this: 

1st courses:
Me: Jamon Serrano - see opening quote.
BF: Chorizo Pamplona - delicious.
Me: Chicken Brochette - very nicely seasoned.
BF: Arugula: decent portion, the fried goat cheese was awesome.

2nd courses:
Me: Pulpo - paired very nicely with the lemon powder, cooked perfectly.
BF: Merluza en Salsa Verde (sea bass with cockles) - this was my fave.
Me: Asparagus - cooked wonderfully but not second course-worthy.
BF: Duck Montadito - amazing, no wonder it's a signature dish.

Years ago, there existed a very small little shop also named Dim Sum Garden in what is now known as Tom's Dim Sum, in the previously-decrepit Chinatown tunnel. I was a child when I went there, and was delighted by all the small eats they had - it brought me back to Shanghai and its delicious dim sum.

Imagine by dismay when I came back years later and it was closed, and my elation when I realized a new spot with the same name opened up next to what was once the Chinatown Bazaar and it's oddities, now Chinatown Square. Going there, I was brought back to the same delectable dim sum dishes that I once knew, and I lived joyously knowing I had a source of good dim sum in Philadelphia.

Over the years, I've continued going here, enjoying their Xiao Long Bao, Pan Fried Soup Dumplings, and Shao Mai, among other things. The quality has waned a bit and become more expensive - after all, it has become a must-see tourist spot, but I will not say I wouldn't continue to enjoy dim sum here from time to time.

+ Pumpkin Cannoli French Toast - wow, so good
+ Breakfast burrito - awesome

I've come on several occasions to try and see if I like El Rey or not. 
Some of the things I find is the portions seem to be all over the chart.  Sometimes they are huge... sometimes I'm wondering if it's a free sample of what I actually ordered. 

The interior (although this is the theme and the look they are going for) is just plain dingy and tacky.  I know I know write me all you want and tell me that that's the look. I get it... but I don't want it.

The service (for having a 10$ lunch special) is slow.  When offering a 10$ lunch special (and also given your location) El Rey is catering to the working lunch.  Service is friendly and slow. 

The food itself is good. 

Chayote Salad (corn, pickled onion, avocado, lime vinaigrette) is small
Sopa de Tortilla (tomato broth, chicharron, crisp tortilla) very tasty and filling.

Short rib enchiladas are very flavorful.  
Tacos are small portioned and a let down.

For those of you who are unfamiliar with Brazilian steakhouses, you pay a flat fee ($51.50 for dinner, $34.50 for lunch) and you get unlimited trips to a salad bar, unlimited starchy sides (polenta, potatoes, and fried bananas), AND the main reason people come.... unlimited steak (and lamb and sausage and pork and chicken).

Because I work in a male-dominated industry, I have visited Fogo about a half a dozen times for various work functions.  So I have some tips:

-  if you aren't that into steak and are paying for the meal yourself, consider doing just the salad bar.  It is amazing- with tons of options like smoked salmon, various cheeses and salumi, potatoes, big pieces of asparagus, prepared salads like tuna/chicken salad.  And at $24.50, it's a bargain.

- Wait out the better pieces of meat.  They will bring you a lot of meats that are lower quality to start (because they want to fill you up).  If there is a particular cut you like, wait for it to come to you.  Or better yet, let the waiter know and they will send them over to you.

- if you want to experience the fogo-ness but are on a budget, try the lunch option. For $34.50 you get the same meal, but just between the hours of 11:30 and 2:30, Monday through Friday

So why 4 stars rather than 5?  I feel like the meat isn't the greatest quality and a bit too salty.  In the end, I'd rather just get a good steak elsewhere and pay a few more bucks.

Service was odd.  Great at first when we arrived at 6:15 and once we hit 8 PM it was spotty - we were sometimes ignored (like when the soup arrived with no spoons) and then at times hovered over.

In our party of 3 only one of us ordered a ""true"" entree - Branzino - which was delicious.

My friend and I decided to share the duck liver mousse (delicious and light - but small amount of mousse and HUGE amount of grain mustard - I mean, who needs THAT much mustard.)  It was also served sans cornichons - a sacrilege - but 3 small french pickles were brought right away (thankfully for no charge) upon request.

The seafood cocktails - shrimp, crab (2 legs for $18 - ouch) and lobster all were effortless to eat.  ($16 for 4 shrimp - eeek!)  My friend and I were still hungry so she got the French onion soup (and I helped!) which quickly killed our appetites.  (Heavy - but sweet and not to salty and delicious.)

The food is on par with Applebees or other similar places (which is to say it is fine, but nothing that I would ever seek out).  They used to have a deal where you could upgrade your meal with tickets to play games.  I am not sure if this is still available but we all thought it was worth it. 

If you are going with a few people and plan on playing the games together, I'd recommend chipping in together and putting your game money on one card.  It is really annoying when everyone has cards with a little bit of money on them but not enough to play any of the games.

I enjoyed the trivia game, eight people can play at once.  My other favorite game is the six person racing game, which was not working the night I was there.

Around 8pm I called and the friendly hostess was able to squeeze my mom and I in for dinner. Although it can sometimes be a bit loud in the restaurant, once you settle in with your table and engage in conversation, the noise quickly subsides. 

Everything we ordered was fantastic. We started the meal off with a braised short rib flatbread that had melted fontina, truffle oil and portobellos- full of flavor! I love flatbreads because they aren't so doughty - this was almost like matzo.  Then we tried the roasted brussel sprouts which were tasty, but had a lot of shaved cheese which we felt was unnecessary. The sprouts themselves were good enough without the added dairy. Next came the grilled octopus atop a romaine salad with tomatoes -- this was FANTASTIC! I love grilled octopus and have said before in other reviews that it's not the easiest to cook perfectly where it's moist vs. chewy. Well let me tell ya - the chefs nailed it! I have to come back soon just for that! Woweee. Finally, we ordered the chicken Milanese with arugula and tomatoes. This finished the meal perfectly.

We had a large group of people. For some reason they put us in a room where we had to be separated into all different groups with the birthday girl winding up at a two top across from other tables. It kind of defeated the purpose of dining out as a group. We were all sitting on top of each other and completely jammed in like sardines. It wasn't comfortable. They decided to treat us all as separate tables since that's how we were seated...but for some reason they still struggled with taking our order and delivering the food and drinks efficiently. There were disputes amongst the two servers taking care of us which wasn't very professional. If we are separated into two tops and four tops, etc. then it's the same as just having a full station so why such a struggle?! 

I didn't love anything on the menu and my stomach was bothering me so I tried to go as plain as possible. Their only salmon option was farmed. Why would you serve farmed fish at a restaurant? Nice restaurants don't serve farmed fish and they definitely don't charge $35 for it!!! I wouldn't eat anything else on the menu so I asked her if I could do it as a plain grilled fish versus the preparation stated on the menu. She said yes. I asked if I could do rice. She told me there was no rice and that I could do plain potatoes. I said ok. We continued to wait another 45 minutes before placing our order so I had time to look at the menu more. I noticed jasmine rice listed under another menu item. When our server returned, I asked her if I could have that rice. She said yes. Soooo, you didn't realize you had that rice? You were trying to get away with not offering it? I don't know. Weird. The farmed salmon was disgusting and I didn't eat it. I got charged the same price as the fancy preparation of the salmon so I paid about $35 for a disgusting piece of farmed salmon that I didn't eat and plain rice. I was grateful for the rice. 

I asked for a Kir Royale. She said ok. I asked if she knew what it was. She said yes. I said I wanted it with chambord (because sometimes people serve it to me with cassis) she said ok. She returned and asked me if I wanted it on the rocks or straight up. I now had confirmation that she doesn't know what a Kir royale is despite saying she did. I restate the fact that it is champagne and chambord and that it is served in a champagne glass. She said ok. What felt like a half hour later, she returned with a martini glass and something that was a very wrong color. I tasted it. I had no idea what it was but it wasn't a Kir Royale. It was going to be too much trouble to try to fix the situation so I just drank it. 

The decor seems very dated and it looks like they could use a good cleaning...or a total remodel. The bathrooms in the back are tiny and you always have to wait and while you are waiting you are able to observe some very unhygienic practices going on at their server station which I'm glad I didn't see until the end of the experience. 

The service was so slow that despite having plenty of time between our reservation and the show we were going to afterwards, we were late for the show which was then sold out and some of us didn't get in. 

Parking was easy. The place is large so there's lots of seating available. There are lots of different rooms that are all decorated differently. There are multiple floors.

J'adore the interior, always have, along with the songbook to boot (I mean, I might be in the minority here, considering my heritage, but I can't get enough of Joe Dassin, Jacques Brel, and yes, the Amelie soundtrack - it never gets old). 

From the elegant restrooms, traditional decor, marble-topped bar and the high vaulted ceilings, even the gorgeous Laguiole knives, it's the attention to detail that puts me over the moon.  Service is always pleasant, accurate, present and knowledgeable (even though their pronunciation isn't on point, and their insistence of saying pree fee for 'prix fixe' when it's actually pree feexe - but bah! small potatoes).  Along with Talula's Garden, this place is perfect for a nice dinner out with the folks or for a date destination set for romance.

Summer brings about a menu that is all-Provençal and that embraces those vegetables of summer, tomatoes, eggplant and zucchini:  an end result that was wonderfully executed in a delicious ratatouille.  A zippy tapenade amuse bouche starts off any meal right -- and of course,  I  still love their amazing crunchy, buttery baguette bread (can I buy to take home?) and their escargots (this time finished with anchovy, bone marrow and garlic) - which is always utter perfection.  Their wine selections also reflected the Provence focus, with some great Rosés and a Languenoc red (Domaine Magellan) that will blow your socks off (not available at state stores, we were told, but Moore Brothers carries it).  Chef Woolsey and his team do not dissappoint.   Meat is always cooked on point (duck, lamb, beef, even frogs' legs, although the large ones aren't always as tender as the smaller ones), every item is flavored perfectly, delicately and meal progression is so well-timed, no rush, no fuss -- and you know what?  Desserts are bangin', too.

I love the simple but creative menu. For example: the chorizo, sweet potato hash with eggs on top. The flavor combos are perfect.

This time around I went with the potato pancakes benedict (poached eggs and smoked salmon over the potato and topped with hollandaise). My P.I.C. got the ham steak and eggs special* which was also amazing. The service was great....coffee and OJ never went dry.

I also was sure to grab several baked goods on the way out. The cinnamon buns are outrageously good. The glaze is super thick. Definitely some of the best I've ever had.

I went based off a recommendation from a friend (Roopa S. - always has spot on recs, btw) and I was not disappointed. 

Ambiance: Small, cute, romantic. Tons of candles, diml lighting and an intimate space. The restaurant was very small, so it's likely you'll get seated very close to another table (can be bothersome if it's a loud party, but not a game changer). However, the restaurant was extremely cozy and felt perfect for a date night or for a night out with a close friend. 

Service: Amazing service. The waiter was so friendly and helpful in giving us recs, it was just what we need to navigate through the huge menu. 

Food: 
1) Arancini - my first time trying arancini! I was a huge fan. I absolutely loved the soft risotto and cheese textures with each bite, and the pesto sauce that accompanied the dish was a perfect balance to make a dish a little more moist. I can't wait to keep trying this dish at other restaurants! 
2) Mushroom pizza - the size was the best part. It didn't stand out in terms of flavors but the mushrooms were plentiful and the crust was thin and crispy, like I love crusts to be. 
3) BUDINO : Too many reviews bragging about this dish so I'll just leave it at don't forget to save some room for this deliciousness, ESP if you're a salted caramel fan! 

Tips:
+Reservations are pretty hard to get - we made a reservation for a party of 2 a month in advance and still only got a 9:30 reservation time. They have walk ins but it's pretty rare to get a table like that (We saw a couple walk in around 10pm and the attendant at the front said that the next table would be available at 11:30 pm...?). 
+The small plates seem to be their highlights - I would recommend trying a few of those!

I've eaten in justtttt about 80% of the best restaurants in Philly. And I'm talking about restaurants renowned for their AMAZING food, whether they were budget corner spots or $50+ a plate. Zahav took me a while to get to (not sure why, but it did) BUT it was worth the wait and made it to my top 5.

I LOVE their slightly secret location. I've frequented Old City/Society Hill for years and eat regularly at their neighbor, Positano Coast. So I'm not sure why I never noticed Zahav. On a whim, I decided that it would be where I would take my boyfriend for his birthday, just because it had SUCH good reviews on OpenTable and one lucky little reservation. I adore their simple, open decor that reminds me of a market in Tel Aviv. It was clean and sophisticated but comfortable and unique, with that private feel that you get from an elevated restaurant in a dark corner of a quiet side street, surrounded by bushes and landscaping.  It's dressy casual so it's perfect for date night or post-happy hour dinner with your best friend. 

Now that we have all the extras out of the way, let's talk about what really matters: SERVICE and FOOD!!!

I've been a server for many years. It's not rocket science, but not everyone can deliver rockstar service. It's a bit of an art, and the best service requires teamwork. This place had possibly THE BEST SERVICE I've received in the city. Our server was knowledgable and volunteered advice and explanations about the fairly exotic Israeli food. She never steered us wrong...all of her suggestions were amazing....but we'll get to that in a minute. The drinks took a little while but the bar was full and that's totally forgivable. Otherwise, our water glasses were always full, and an empty plate never sat for more than a minute before it was removed. It was perfectly synchronized service between the server, food runner, busser, and any other staff that walked by. Everyone chipped in to make the experience flawless!! 

Now, for the good part: their unbelievable, delectable food!! 
Zahav offers both ala carte and prix fixe options. The two prix fixe option are $39 and $48, with the main difference being that the higher priced option offered a chef's selection of mezze and the entree was their signature lamb shoulder. My boyfriend wasn't feeling the lamb (although after seeing it come out of the kitchen a few times, he definitely wanted to come back and try it...I second the idea), so we decided on the $39 menu which included salatim and hummus (a mix of salads and spreads), a choice of 2 mezze per person, one entree, and a desert. My boyfriend wanted to try an extra entree so he ordered an extra kebab (that we really didn't need).  Given that each item is at least $8, it's a no-brainer to go for the prix fixe! 

Let me tell you, it was one of the best meals I've had since I can remember. The hummus and laffa were delicious, as well all of the salatim! They reminded me a lot of food I'd eat as a child (Russian cuisine has a lot of similarities with Isreali cuisine). 
 
For our mezze, we ordered the brussel sprouts, sea bass crudo, grilled duck hearts, and the house smoked sable. All were delicious, but the duck hearts were an instant favorite....don't ewwww. They were amazing, and if you can get past the mental image of Aaliyah in Queen of the Damned sucking the blood out of a beating heart, they might be your new favorite too! 

I'm not sure what our entrees were...but they were equally fantastic! I definitely want to come back for the lamb shoulder!! That just looked like a giant hunk of incredible!!  

Our deserts were the perfect end to a perfect meal and weren't too sweet (I'm sweet enough as it is, I don't need the extra sugar!). And their coffee was STRONG as coffee should me. Speaking of strong, we put back a couple cocktails while we were there. My boyfriend loved his!! I liked mine but because I had a cold, I went for the whiskey and bourbon drinks (Irish cough syrup!!), which were delicious but the strong flavor didn't match the light flavorful food. 

ANNYYYWAYYYYY......To sum up this epicly long visual of my phenom experience, I would definitely recommend this as an authentic, incredible alternative to your typical date night or family dinner or whatever. The prix fixe menu is THE way to go. You will not be disappointed! The amount of food will leave you full but not in a food coma (a sacred art). The service rivals that of any other 4 star restaurant in the city. Don't be afraid to go out of your comfort zone, duck hearts might become your new fave!!",2013-02-21 02:53:37,Zahav,237 St James Pl,Philadelphia,PA,19106,39.9462611465,-75.1451350779,4.5,3065.0,1.0,"{'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""'full_bar'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '4', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'None'}","Nightlife, Bars, Food, Ethnic Food, Middle Eastern, Vegetarian, Specialty Food, Israeli, Restaurants","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '16:45-21:30', 'Wednesday': '16:45-21:30', 'Thursday': '16:45-21:30', 'Friday': '16:45-21:30', 'Saturday': '16:45-21:30'}"

The chicken liver mousse was the star of the show, so creamy and tasty! We used up the house made rye bread right away and our waitress brought us more bread so we could sop up the rest of the liver mousse.

Dizengoff does wonders with a limited menu of rich, creamy hummus, topping each dish with a rotating selection of meats and veggies.  The pita is the fluffiest, softest, and chewiest I've ever had.  And the lemonnana is a deliciously tart, herbaceous (mint & basil?) frozen treat.  Everything was phenomenal!

Word to the wise -- let the kitchen know if you have any food allergies.  I ordered the beet hummus, which to my surprise came with raisins, pistachios, and other delicious spices along with the shredded beets.  Go ahead and get selfish -- order an extra pita for $1 so you can split your dish into two meals.

Pro tip: it's been several weeks since Dizengoff opened and they still sell out of pita/ platters.  Get there before 2pm to satisfy your craving.  When we got in line (1pm or so) there were no seats available, but by the time we ordered there were several seats open.

Chef's tasting menu: one pick from each category besides the sharing for two + dessert bite; a very satisfying meal 

Tasting notes:
-mushroom farro: nutty and savory, a healthy blend of shaved greens and chewy farro, with crunchy chips and a soft-boiled egg on top
-lamb meatballs: very tender and juicy, not crumbly, served in a cast-iron pan drenched in a rich tomato-y sauce with sweet dates and yogurt drizzled in, with crusty, toasted french bread slices perfect for sopping up leftover sauce
-big eye tuna poke: refreshing mix of avocado and tuna chunks with a great crunch from the toasted macadamia nut halves
-spinach pizza: puffy, airy crust with just enough flavor from the cheese, covered with large, oven-roasted leaves of spinach
-brussel sprouts: soft, a few burnt edges; thick slivers of almost hammy, smoked bacon; mustard seeds added an interesting texture and flavor
-ricotta gnocchi: small pieces in a chunky tomato sauce; forgettable but also was getting super full by the time it got to the table! 
-flat iron steak, medium rare: gently caramelized exterior with a soft chew, served sliced with whole peppers and a few mushroom caps 
-key lime whoopie pie: cakey cookies, flavor enhanced by lime syrup drops; torched marshmallow fluff was a nice touch

A recent dinner confirmed the fact that I've been missing out. The beer list, as expected for any respectable Philly gastropub, offered numerous choices for any palette conveniently divided between ""strong"" and ""session"" brews. Though other reviewers find this system of classification irksome, it makes deciding on one of the twenty-two taps simpler than usual. The beer prices do run a bit high, but certainly aren't unaffordable.

We began the meal pleasantly with an order of Varga's famous crab and cheese fries. The cheese sauce ladled on top of the crisp, thin spuds provided a pleasant, milky tang with a creamy texture. Even when it inevitably congealed from sitting at room temperature too long, the combination of the aforementioned cheese sauce and ample chunks of lump crab complimented each other well, and this fry creation subsequently was as good as advertised.

Our main dishes similarly hit the spot. A friend ordered the pork belly cubano (a special that day) which brought crunchy yet soft pressed bread and decidedly porcine meat in a compact sandwich vehicle. His sandwich ranked among the better Cubans I've tried in the city, yet my fried oyster po-boy tasted even better. Though not a po-boy in the authentic sense, it brought a fantastic combination of flavors and textures. Namely, the shatteringly crisp yet pillowy soft french bread, oceanic oysters, light cole slaw, and house pickles struck a harmonious, gustatory chord. The sandwich actually outclasses my previous favorite at Khyber Pass. Old-bay fries served alongside maintained a pleasant crisp even after a bit of time on the table.

Other perks of Varga include a 4-6 happy hour with half-off drafts and buck-a-shuck oysters all day, making for some potentially economical drinking and munching. Even without specials, the food didn't cost too much given the ample portions and ingredient quality. I certainly will return to sample the menu further.",2014-04-21 20:48:23,Varga Bar,941 Spruce St,Philadelphia,PA,19107,39.9462043942,-75.1577992928,3.5,597.0,1.0,"{'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'HasTV': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': None, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': False}"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': None, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}""}","Nightlife, Bars, American (New), Gastropubs, Restaurants","{'Monday': '16:0-21:0', 'Tuesday': '16:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '16:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-21:0', 'Friday': '16:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-21:0'}"

I originally had a group of 23, but due to scheduling errors, only 10 of us showed up. They were very accommodating and the servers were all very nice. Right from when we sat down, they starting serving us. Our first course was a spring ginger salad minus the shrimp. I absolutely love Burmese salads and this was no disappointment. The ginger was so strong but oh so good. And there were many other add-ins that gave it a nice crunch too.

We were next served the thousand layer bread with potato curry. It reminded me a lot of Malaysian roti canai. The bread was nice and flaky and the curry had just the right spice level. Not too filling but a great tasting appetizer. Next came all the main dishes. I don't remember all the names, but we had chili shrimp, coconut curry chicken, vegetarian delight, and vegetarian Northern Burma fried noodle.

The chili shrimp was fantastic. It was slightly overcooked, but the breading on the outside was just right and didn't drown out the meat. The seasoning and sauces was spot on. Loved every crunch. The coconut curry chicken was nothing special. I've had curry at multiple places and this one didn't really stand out. Vegetarian delight was same old, same old. Just your standard stir fried veggies with tofu in a mixture of sauces. Unfortunately, the Northern Burma fried noodles were awful. There was almost no flavor. I wasn't sure if they just didn't add enough seasoning, or if the chili sauce they used overpowered what little flavor it had. Either way, the noodles were a little painful to eat, with nothing but the ""spicy"" flavor greeting your mouth. And the add-ins weren't exciting either.

The food wasn't that great, but the good dishes were pretty solid and there's a lot on the menu I'd love to go back and try. And the service was awesome and speedy.

Pros: Service, variety of menu (so many options!)
Cons: some bland flavors, a little pricey for portions

My and wife and I celebrated our 1st anniversary here and it was amazing! Our names with congratulations were on the menu, all service staff all sent their well wishes, and we were offered a complimentary champagne toast! 
This was truly a great anniversary!

Oh, the food.. 
The food is as outstanding as the service. We did the warm Turkish hummus with pita. For the next portion we got 4 small plates to share.

1) Fried Cauliflower - this had labneh, mint, lemon, and aleppo accompanied with it. It was made perfectly! We loved this dish. 

2) Mushroom Schnitzel - this dish came with celery, tehina, mustard greens, and fresno. Another fabulous dish. Really enjoyed this as well! My wife said she would easily get this again. 

3) Haloumi in brik- Accompanied with passion fruit, walnut, and pickled onions. This was absolutely delicious. 
It was definitely a dish I would want again. 

4) Brussels Sprouts - this came with pickled apples, schug, and Brussels baba! We both went nuts over this dish! It was by far our favorite. An ""A+"" amongst ""A"". 

Finally to wrap things up we got the hazelnut cake that had whipped labneh and Asian pears. Loved this dessert! Glad we went with this!

Overall, with no surprise, this was an amazing place to come for our anniversary. We had high expectations and they were EXCEEDED! There is no doubt that we will be back, it's a matter of getting a reservation! 

Also, the service can not be talked about enough. Alicia was on top of her water game. Constantly filled it up, and even protected us and the table from splashes by holding a napkin to guard. Our waitress was also amazing (forgot her name), but she was very bubbly and informative with the menu. Also, she was very attentive. Everyone was amazing here!

My machine also kept forgetting my orders when I clicked back which was frustrating. The options were plentiful and unique and very specific (light dressing, on the side, etc).

I got mixed greens with whole wheat noodles with baked tofu, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro ranch dressing. The wheat noodles definitely had a coat of oil on them which I didn't like. OD on the onions. Dressing was really good. Total $8.75. Granted I was very full after.

Must get: toast (fromage + kumquats), warm lentils, non-alcoholic ginger drink, fettuccine, daily specials
Meh: squid salad, pork sausage
Missed out: main courses


Vernick is one of the more coveted Philadelphia eateries in downtown Center City that requires at least 2-3 weeks of planning and reservation in advance. We came here for an early dinner, celebrating our wedding anniversary and were immediately seated next to the window aisle with beautiful potted plants hanging overhead and a nice view of the Walnut street. The highlight of Vernick, however, is the staff. While there were other reviews that mentioned less attentive staff, I will say that Ethan, our server extraordinaire, was amazing. He was very honest about specific dishes, mentioned foods that were safe for my pregnant wife, and even took back a dish that was too salty and removed it from the bill all together. That being said, the overall service was fantastic, with attention to details, multiple table cleaning and well-timed water refills.

I'm not going to lie, Vernick was not cheap, the two of us ordered only tapas-dishes (fairly sizable) and easily racked a $130+ bill with just one non-alcoholic beverage (totally worth it). My must gets are the toast, the lentils and the fish. The other meat dishes were incredibly salty to a point where I had to stop or else I'll drown myself in water. I had high hopes for the squid salad, but it failed to appeal to me artistically, and I wished the squid tentacles had a greater mouth feel and brinier taste.

At the end of the day, if you have the time and the money, Vernick is an excellent spot for business, casual or dating. My one recommendation is to lay low on the salt.

My partner and I ordered the chorizo (Mexican sausage) tacos de la casa and costilla de res (short rib) tacos de la plancha, respectively. No complaints about the tacos! My goodness we loved the seasoning, texture, and the salsa verde/salsa roja. We also loved the horchata. The only product that fell flat was the choco-flan. I bought it on impulse, texture was fine; however, the flavor was flat. I was disappointed the flan was bland and so was the chocolate cake. With that said I'll give their regular flan a chance next time.

Me and the missus visited Butcher Bar a few months ago when we were looking to grab a bite before heading to a comedy show.  That first experience was great all around: food, drinks, and service.  We couldn't wait to return so we made our way back downtown on a nice Sunday afternoon for our second visit.  We lucked up and found a parking spot across the street from the restaurant.  We observed that Butcher Bar offered curbside seating but we opted to sit inside.  We were seated at a nice table for two on the second level.  I didn't realize how beautiful the outside courtyard is until we finished our meal.  I will ask to sit there next visit.  Butcher Bar has a bar located at the front of the venue and a second is located in the courtyard.  The glass enclosed kitchen allows patrons to get a look at the chefs and the delicious food being prepared.  Shortly after being seated our waiter came to the table with water.  He told us about the specials and took our drink order.  I opted for the Citywide a 1 oz. shot of house made rock and rye with a can of 2SP Delco Lager.  My lovely dining companion ordered the Peach Blossom which consisted of crystal head vodka, peach liqueur, peach puree, orange juice, and lime juice.  We enjoyed our libations while perusing the menu.  We started with Mexican meatballs as an appetizer. Carne asada, crispy tortilla, guacamole, and pico de gallo.  The meatballs came out and looked amazing. They tasted great and were quickly finished off.  We also had the BOSC PEAR, BABY KALE & QUINOA SALAD.  Made with goat cheese, red onion, candied pecans, spiced cider vinaigrette.  It was yummy also.  It was Sunday and I was tempted to get the prime rib.  I had it on my first visit and it was delicious but I landed on the PEANUT BUTTER BACON BISON BURGER with cheddar cheese, candied bacon, bibb lettuce, tomato, side of house-cut fries.  I don't know who is responsible for this combination but Thank You.  That burger was a great experience.  The delicious bison meat and the candied bacon alongside the peanut butter and side of sweet sauce. Two thumbs up!  The missus ordered the RIGATONI W/ BROCCOLI RABE, ITALIAN SAUSAGE, OLIVE OIL, GARLIC-PARMESAN BROTH.  She enjoyed the dish and allowed me to taste a piece of sausage which was so good. Thank you Butcher Bar for another great dining experience.

The greatest shortcoming is that the sushi here is not the freshest.  This was disappointing as I stood waiting in anticipation for those sitting down to finish and leave.  With no shortage of customers, you'd think the food was undeniably fresh/good if not great.  This was one of very few instances when I've sat down in a sushi restaurant and left sushi behind.  I can't figure out why there is this great following but I can only assume that a lower price point relative to other sushi joints in the area may be the reason why.

I'm not sure if the folks behind the counter are certified at their profession.  I didn't find precision in the rolls that were made for me.  Sure the tuna dumplings look good and I did finish my order of them but the remaining rolls I was served was presented/created sloppy.

I stopped in here with a friend recently and I very much enjoyed both the service and the food.  I arrived early so I sat at the bar.  The bartender let me sample all 3 of their cask ales and I ended up going wit his original recommendation.  While I waited, I asked him what his favorite thing on the menu was.  Without delay, he said ""the chicken and duck liver parfait.""  Fortunately, when my friend arrived, she agreed to try that.

We ordered oysters, deviled eggs, the parfait, the pint of prawns and the beet cured salmon.  The oysters were delicious and fresh, not very briny.  The deviled eggs were just right and had a hint of curry and cayenne in them.  The pint of prawns was closer to a shrimp cocktail but the shrimp were done perfectly.  I really enjoyed the salmon, along with the dill and crème fraiche that it was served with.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the parfait, but the portion was very large.  They give you three slices of brioche which is clearly not enough.  We even ordered a second batch of brioche and it still wasn't enough for all the parfait.  It's very rich and I recommend having it, but maybe splitting it among 3 or 4 people.

The layout and decor of this place is really cool and I can see myself stopping back in here for drinks and a bite to eat.  The bartenders are nice, knowledgeable and will go out of their way to make sure you have a good time.

Service was very prompt and fast. They cranked through a long line of people in front of me in a very short time span. I made my order, got my drink, paid for the sandwich and drink and presto! My sandwich was ready.

The sandwich came out a steaming pile of beef with dripping juices that smelled pretty good. The meat was tender and moist and had a lot of flavor to it. The juices also had a lot of flavor in it and really helped make the sandwich. I wasn't as impressed with the roll/bread that the meat was in.

We got the chef's selection tasting menu.  We had no idea what was coming next, or even if there was more food coming.  That meant I didn't pace myself and could barely find room to taste the last few dishes.  Just when we thought we were done, more food arrived.  The first course (or round) of dishes was overwhelming.  Six dishes at once was a bit much.  I would have preferred to stagger them a bit.  We could barely fit it all on our table.  But I did enjoy everything, especially the goat cheese with a cherry-fig something or other.  

The service was good.  Our waiter was enthusiastic and knowledgeable but not overbearing.  He answered questions and chatted about the dishes.

To drink, we ordered a pitcher of sangria.  It was good but would probably be better suited to a hot day.  Next time I'd opt for some regular wine that might pair better with the food.

The negative: it was LOUD.  Tables are close together, and we got caught in the middle of a conversation between people on either side of us (they'd struck up a discussion before we arrived).

The weekend brunch buffet (offered Saturdays & Sundays) has a whole different vibe than the ""other"" (same place) sit -down restaurant. If you're wondering (and I was) the weekend brunch options are basically the same on both Saturdays and Sundays (I asked). But from what I understand, the flavors of the scones and quiches change periodically and I imagine some of the seasonal offerings may change as well. There wasn't that much that was seasonal so it's probably fairly consistent.

Food/drink cont'd.
I really enjoyed the all you can eat brunch as a whole and though I didn't try every single item, I certainly enjoyed what I tried. My favorite items were the roast prime rib and the fried potatoes. If there had been a roasted vegetable and a popover, it would have been a classic ""Sunday Roast."" I was hoping they'd have a Caesar salad option, but not all wishes come true. None the less, the offerings were still very, very good- in fact it was one of the best brunch buffets I've ever attended, including the one at Lacroix! 
The pot de creme chocolate was delicious, especially with the fresh berries. I also enjoyed the smoked salmon/bagel option. 

We also ordered a bottle of sparkling wine to mix with the OJ and GFJ options included with the brunch which also included iced or hot coffee or iced or hot tea(unlimited). All of this was $28/person. The bottle of sparkling wine was $44. For Center City, these prices are great!

And unlike a lot of the all you can eat places, the quality of the food was excellent. I usually know afterward by how thirsty I am. And since I'm not thirsty at all, I think that means the food wasn't full of preservatives and other cheap flavor enhancers to make up for quality. I thought the smoked salmon was not at all over the top salty which made it extra yummy. I took lots of photos. There was something for everyone on that brunch buffet and I recommend it to everyone who likes to eat. 

Re. Photos, I didn't capture everything served on the brunch menu. So there will be a few fun surprises when it's your turn to experience H&C weekend brunch!

Service:
One of the highlights of the day was the gentleman who served the prime rib and also made the waffles. I should have asked him his name! He was outstanding! With a great personality, he hand sliced with perfection! He was also very nice and professional and I could tell he took pride in his work! He really enjoyed it and when you feel that, it makes the whole experience that much better! He's a keeper!!! I see great things for his future!

Adam our server was terrific and there was plenty of support staff to grab our empty plates. I noticed they got pretty aggressive near the end and not as attentive at the beginning which felt not so great; especially since we still had half of a bottle of wine to drink when they started hanging about us. So it felt a bit presumptive. If they really wanted us to go, perhaps they should have refilled our glasses with the wine instead of attempting to snatch our plates away before we were finished. That would have been a more diplomatic approach and its not easy for everyone to pour their own wine. 

In spite of that one not so fun issue, it was a great  experience and again I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys brunch or just enjoys food.",2018-10-13 19:21:20,Harp & Crown,1525 Sansom St,Philadelphia,PA,19102,39.9504170438,-75.1664282754,4.0,912.0,1.0,"{'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'None', 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': True, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': False, 'wednesday': True, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}"", 'CoatCheck': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'HasTV': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': None, 'latenight': None, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': False}"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True'}","Active Life, Nightlife, Bars, American (Traditional), Bowling, Restaurants, American (New), Gastropubs","{'Tuesday': '16:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '16:0-23:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-23:0', 'Friday': '16:0-0:0', 'Saturday': '16:0-0:0', 'Sunday': '10:30-14:30'}"

I want to say lots of positive things, but most of that goes towards the ambiance. You really can't beat this view. Everyone is so hyped up that George Sabatino is here, and I don't mean to be hard on the guy, but it's not just food that I'm droooling over. 

I ordered the cheeseburger and my friend ordered the bacon sandwich. The cheeseburger was fine, but if I'm going to pay that much, I'd rather go to Shake Shack. And it's still a pet peeve of mine when they don't come with fries and you have to pay extra. Though I am a fan of pickled veggies, which all the sandwiches here come with. My friend's bacon sandwich was very dry. The bread definitely needed more than some residual fat and swipe of mustard. It needs a sauce. I tried to use the aioli from the fries but it still didn't quite do the trick. The Really Good Fries are not as good as advertised. They're overly salty and the aioli is not spicy.

$-$$; not too pricey, featuring apps from $5 and up, to pitchers of beer up to ~$30. 

Food:
Hot & fresh; we received our two appetizers (beer battered onion rings & rosemary gravy fries) within 5 minutes. Pretty average bar food, nothing too special. 

Atmosphere:
Very relaxing, and especially nice on a night with good weather. The kitchen and part of the dining area is covered, so it would still hold up on a rainy day. The only qualm I have is that the only area serving food is pretty loud and crowded, whereas the quieter parts only serve alcohol. 

Overall:
Definitely would return. Especially for a Day 3-post opening, the IBG ran pretty quickly & efficiently with hot/fresh food.

-One side only serves alcohol, while the other side serves both food & alcohol.

I'm not the biggest fan of matcha, so I ordered the Sizzling Ice Cream because I was under the impression that the brownie was chocolate. When the brownie arrived, I realized that it was actually matcha. You get to chose your flavor of ice cream and they had a few different ones, such as salted caramel, watermelon,and green tea, and I chose the green tea. When the dish comes out, the matcha brownie and ice cream are on the hot skillet and the server pours cream on it, which results in sizzling. Considering that I don't care for matcha, I was pleasantly surprised by the Sizzling Ice Cream, but I don't know if I would get it again. My friend ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake and she really liked it. It also came with a side of green tea ice cream.

First off, the NYC location does a much better job with the food.  Second, there are so many better fusion or fine dining options in Philly.

Food Review
Crispy calamari salad.  Salad was ok, dressing is nice and light. Calamari is fried and batter was too thick and oily with a slight burnt oil aftertaste.  Continental does a better job at the same salad.

Edamame raviolli: house speciality, it's really good with a very creamy and smooth filling, my only complaint is there's not enough on the plate and you need to order at least 2 dishes if you plan on sharing the appetizers with the table.

Lobster fried rice: wouldn't know, it never made it to our table.  It was ordered, it was on our bill.  Chalk this one up to mediocre service.

Szechuan braised short rib:  Rich and filling.  It is served ontop of a long roasted bone, making the meat portion look small, however you'll have a hard time finishing the whole dish,  Nice crispy outside with a fatty and moist interior that falls apart on your fork.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this dish.

Pan seared sea bass: Average, personally I think it had a slight fishy note to it, but the rest of the table liked it.

Service Review
Hostesses at the front are warm and greeting and quick to take and later return your checked coat.

Waitress was scarce and didn't check back with us after the food was delivered...otherwise she might have been told we didn't get our lobster fried rice.  Bus boys seem to be the hardest working in the restaurant as 2 minutes after finishing something, the plate was being removed from the table, and my glass of water never got below the halfway mark.  Starr should give the busboys and water boys all a raise because they're carrying the slack for the lazy waitresses.

Restaurant Review
The decor is getting a little dated, might be time for a slight refresh.  My date asked for a black napkin so she didn't get lint on her black dress and no one could find one.  Seriously?  I expect a higher end restaurant known for it's nightlife and scene where more than half the room is wearing black, to have black napkins onhand for these requests.  Also, the bathrooms still use the cheap papertowels you'd expect to find at a bus depot.

Overall, it's a solid 3 star night out.  It won't be your best experience in Philadelphia, but you won't be disappointed if you are just going in for a nice dinner.  I woudn't go for a special occasion or to impress anyone, but the ravioli dish will keep us coming back every month or two.",2013-01-09 21:46:19,Buddakan,325 Chestnut St,Philadelphia,PA,19106,39.9489186,-75.1471667,4.0,1561.0,1.0,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'Corkage': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '3', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'Alcohol': ""'full_bar'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BYOBCorkage': ""'yes_corkage'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'dressy'"", 'BYOB': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'RestaurantsCounterService': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': None, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'loud'""}","Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Chinese","{'Monday': '17:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '17:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '17:0-22:0', 'Friday': '16:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '16:0-20:0', 'Sunday': '16:0-21:0'}"

In Riva is adorable and in a prime location to attract all the people on Kelly Drive.  It worked.  They are bike and dog friendly aka tons of bike parking and a huge outdoor patio seating area that overlooks the river.  The only bummer? Happy hour prices are only inside.  But, I can live with that.

We got a specialty cocktail- something with vodka, wine and orange soda.  It was delicious and refreshing.  They also had a cheap beer special.  The total bill for 3 people at 2 drinks each was under $20!!!

The service here was great.  Everyone was extremely friendly, welcoming and attentive.

If you're a vegetarian, or even if you're not, Honey's Veggie Patty Melt is a perfect melding of spicy and sweet with jalapeno's melted into the cheese and a sweet honey mustard sauce to dip the sandwich it in.  I don't know what the patty is made of, but it is quite tasty.  The whole wheat toast makes it even better.  I get it with a side of hand-cut fries, and I love the little salad that comes with it with vinegary cabbage and a slice of a pickled green tomato.  I have a habit of ordering this every time because it is so good, and I'm afraid everything else wouldn't live up to its standard.  
  
       Last night, I decided to venture out and try something new.  I got the home-made turkey burger with fries.  The turkey was well seasoned and moist.  The portions here are quite generous, so I got full and gave my boyfriend the last of my sandwich.  He isn't a huge fan of turkey burgers, but doesn't dislike them.  He bit into it, and was like, ""Oh wow, this is good.""  I don't know what the seasoning was, but we both liked it.  The fries were crispy, fresh cut, and delicious as usual.  The little salad was different and was a purple coleslaw that wasn't a vinegar base instead of the green vinegary cabbage.  That was the only disappointment.  It wasn't bad.  I'm just all about the vinegar.  My boyfriend ordered the vegetarian chicken fried steak with mac and cheese and a biscuit which he seemed to enjoy.   It was a huge portion and the ""chicken"" came smothered in gravy which pleased him.   I ordered a slice of chocolate cake with mocha frosting to go.  The icing tasted like my mom's, which is a good thing because she makes everything from scratch.  The cake was good, but dense and rice and more like a brownie.  

     Honey's recently changed their hours, so I hadn't been there in a while until last night.  Other than the hours changing, I noticed that their specials page seemed smaller, as it used to be double sided.  The one change I noticed that I really liked was that the service was excellent last night.  Usually it takes forever to get the waiter to take your order, the food comes out fast, but it's impossible to flag down a waiter.  In contrast, our waiter last night was fast, polite, helpful, and friendly, although my boyfriend thought he didn't refill his coffee often enough.

And the noodles in the shoyu are much better too..... the wavy noodle is for sure better than the thin straight noodles here. The thin straight were stiff and felt less noodly. But still tasted good. I read a previous review to select wavy noodles instead for the signature tarakawa and I wish I had listened. The chili oil is 10/10. Ive never had better chili oil.

For brunch, you really can't go wrong with any of their selections!  I've tried almost the entire brunch menu and my favorite has been the French Toast.

For dinner, my personal favorite is the Ropa Vieja - I can't recommend this enough.  Ropa Vieja is a signature Cuban dish and Mixto has, by far, the best in Philly!  The paella also does not disappoint.

Just go during happy hour, 5-7 M-F or 1-3 Sat/ Sun, and order yourself the nachos (splurge the extra $1 for a huge scoop of guac). For $6, you'll get a beautiful mound of melty , gooey, crunchy, salty, satisfying chips with no skimping on the toppings. Best paired with 1-2 friends and a draft IPA. My vegetarian friend and I had no qualms about splitting this meat-free dish, and we hardly made a dent before my stomach finally screamed at me to stop binge eating. I probably looked like an animal, shoveling food with my hands - NO SHAME. Best nachos I may have ever eaten.

I also ordered a Chilorio taco (a spicy pulled pork) and a Chorizo & potato taco - both banging, but the Chorizo definitely won. The tacos were small, like smaller than the palm of my hand, and I have little hands (I'm Donald Trump LOL). I was a little disappointed that they cost $2+ each. I'd definitely come back on $1 taco night though.

Beer selection is alright, about 6 on draft and a variety of bottles/ cans, and the bar is full of any liquor you could want. The vibe is very chill - a little dim, a little tight at the bar. Hipster, but not overly; divey but clean.

Bartender was a little harsh. I arrived a little before 5 and I wasn't about to buy a beer when it wasn't on happy hour. When I stated I'd sip on water until 5, she rolled her eyes and kind of gave me 'tude. She was fine otherwise, average bartendery service.

We didn't have a reservation and they were able to seat us fairly quickly. We sat outside, the server was really nice and gave out solid recommendations on drinks. I got the real housewife pouch i.e. the adult Capri Sun. The drink is light but can be dangerous on an empty stomach. My friend got the mulled wine as they were out of cider. I was really craving a burger and they have the impossible on their menu. This was my first time trying one and we also got a plate of the cheese curds to share. I did a summer in Wisconsin so I've had my share of curds , the batter was light but there was this missing spongy springy texture to the curd. The ranch and salsa were okay. The scallion was too light to taste in my opinion so i stuck to the salsa.  

Burger wise the plates had a fantastic presentation. The fries were lightly salted and the perfect thickness. I ate the burger but it felt like the meat substitute was just a transportation system for the lettuce, pickle and tomato. Like I know it was there because I can see it but its not there if that makes sense. My friend had the double patty and simply stated it was meaty so not a lot of context there.

I lived in florence and this place is a different kind of italian but still authentic nonetheless.  My friends and I ordered the menu tourista which is 35 dollars for a 4 course meal (includes antipasti, pasta, secondi and dessert).  You can choose any dishes, even the specials.  I am so happy I got the N'duja as a starter, I loved the cute little egg sitting on top of the layered sausage and white bean pancake.  The cute pieces of sweet honeyed mushroom really brought out all the flavors of this special dish.   for the pasta I got the Pennoni which is house made penne stuffed with suckling pig, dizzled with cheese and sweet plum sauce- the sweet mingling with the savory sausage- heaven.  For my main, I got the breaded veal with a reduced tomato sauce and dessert which was perfectly breaded and cooked. It was hard to decided between the cardamon panna cotta vs flourless chocolate cake vs tiramisu but I ended up going with the ricotta cheesecake drizzled with salted caramel sauce.  It was creamy, sweet and amazing ;)  I was very happy with all my choices.  The service is attentive and great. 

It was refreshing to have the pleasure of tasting such good food in adequate and appropriate portions (meaning these are NOT typical american portions that are large enough to feed a whole nigerian family- some people might even think these portions are small), and not feel sick but nicely sated and happy after such a wonderfully cooked meal.

before i begin my review on the food. i need to proclaim my foodie crush on mr. joseph. the OG beddia pizza was just pure raw pizza goodness. mainly probably because joe put his 100% into every single pie that went out. but because of this, people complained they would have to wait outside and asked for an easier way to consume his pizza. SO... he came up with a solution. open a bigger place to hold more customers but that also means more staff to help him make all the pizzas. so yeah it's not gonna be exactly like the OG but this new restaurant embodies his vibe, his style and energy; from the food, to the music played to the design & layout of the place. i respect him and what this restaurant represents. joe's answer to the people!


okay now to the good stuff! i got a glass of wine, a slice of tomato pie, roasted vegetables and a plain pie w/ mushrooms and sausage

wine - this was $12, i know he loves/knows his wine so i didn't expect anything else. it was good though, friends i was with didn't want to get a bottle but i think that's the better deal here

tomato pie - this was 50/50; sauce was ON POINT but the dough was super chewy and tough, almost on the stale side but the sauce made up for it. also a little bit too much oil for my taste on top

roasted veg w/ caesar - this was good. loved the acidity, i wish there was more zucchini and less cabbage

PIZZA - the mushrooms are sooooooooo tasty. the sausage was flavorful and the cheese was good but i wanted a little bit more. the crust was perfectly crispy.

The space is small but we somehow managed to fit at a table along the window, which was great because we felt like we had our own little nook all to ourselves! Not to mention it was christmastime, so there was a huge wreath in the window which was great for pictures! 

The food here is amazing. In fact, I would have been satisfied with just the first two appetizers we ordered, which were the crispy brussel sprouts and the mushroom platter. I love homey, earthy food and this was just that! Warm, rich and savory, and melt in your mouth delicious. The American Wagyu was equally as satisfying (the crispy rice cakes really make the dish), but the pork chop special was somewhat of a let down.

I was so excited to try a restaurant on opening night for the first time ever in my life. But then I didn't get to because they opened a day earlier. Boohoo, I know. Get over it. Waaaahhh. 

To start, the ambience and decor are amazing. The attention to detail is fantastic. We were seated right behind the hostess station, so I was a little bummed not to really see the whole place at first. I made sure to go to the ladies room so I could check out the rest of the place. I definitely want to sit at the bar and have drinks and late night bites sometime soon. 

Our server was nice, but I got the impression that she had previously worked in a chain restaurant setting. She kept telling us her favorite dishes, but didn't seem to have the full knowledge of the menu. I can't put my finger on it, but something was lacking. One of the bussers had to give us a second bottle of water (tap) at the end of the meal because she didn't pay attention to the fact that it sat empty for a while, she brought our check without asking if we wanted anything else (I wanted one last cocktail as my husband had a full drink), and she suggested the Fat Elvis for dessert after she knew we were both vegetarian and had ordered all vegetarian items(it has bacon and marshmallow in it). Stuff like that is not something I expect after only experiencing amazing service at Jamonera, Barbuzzo, and Little Nonna's. 

The food was mostly perfection. We ordered the skillet bread, which was so delicious, but also crazy filling. My favorite dishes were the cheese curds and heirloom tomato salad. Perfection. 
The sauteed local greens were a miss. They were so tough we couldn't eat most of them. I thought the tough stems could've been removed or cooked down more. We also tried the Korean Tofu Buns, also perfection. The sweet and spicy sauce. What!?! So yummy. We wanted to try the ravioli, but they had sold out by 9pm. Bummer. 

For dessert we went with the malt ball cake. It was like my Mom's chocolate cake. Crazy moist, flavorful. It totally transported me back to childhood. For drinks we had the Blinker (delish and balanced), Sloe Gin Fizz (a little sweet for me, but very tasty), Ithaca Flower Power and a Victory Pils. The beers are priced well, which we appreciated. My husband asked our server to refresh his memory on the old fashioned drinks and she said the old fashioned was the Marilyn. Again, not great service, because she neglected to inform him that there are in fact two old fashioned drinks on the menu. I know these are dumb things to quibble about, but still. Learn your menu and if you don't know it. Look at it. 

I will definitely go back for a regular dinner and for a late night bites. The cheese curds alone will bring me back in and we want to try those pierogies!",2015-08-29 16:24:41,Bud & Marilyn's,1234 Locust St,Philadelphia,PA,19107,39.947787,-75.162293,4.0,1303.0,1.0,"{'CoatCheck': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""'full_bar'"", 'WiFi': ""'no'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': None, 'latenight': None, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': True, 'breakfast': False}"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': True, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}"", 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2'}","Breakfast & Brunch, Nightlife, Bars, Restaurants, American (Traditional)","{'Monday': '16:0-21:0', 'Tuesday': '16:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '16:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-22:0', 'Friday': '16:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '16:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '16:0-21:0'}"

I finally fixed this mistake when I was recently in the area.  I went in knowing I was going to get the veggie wrap, but while I was waiting they put out a Haymaker pie, so I grabbed a slice of that as well.  The veggie wrap was good, but the veggies needed more seasoning.  It didn't taste like it had any salt or pepper.  I guess they depend on the mustard for flavor, which was good, but I still think the vegetables needed a little something.  I only ate half, so maybe after the vegetables have some time to meld together it will be better.
The pizza was amazing.  I was a little wary of the daiya cheese, but besides the texture being a little strange, I didn't mind it.

Based on the price of the menu and its location, I expected something a bit like Parc - a bit fancy-schmancy, hoity-toity, overpriced and formal. Rouge was not that. It was more like what would happen if you had an old gay grandfather and he had a house party and everyone woke up in the morning and he served them Bloody Marys and mimosas at the counter bar in his kitchen while some of his friends ate breakfast on overstuffed chairs in his livingroom. Which was a little weird but also pretty much exactly what I want my life to be like when I am an old woman. 

The bartender - Tommy - was friendly and chatty. The Bloody Mary was good, although I wish the horseradish wasn't already in the mix since it was a bit spicy for me. The steak and eggs was good - a good portion of steak, cooked exactly how I ordered it, good hollandaise sauce but not poured over everything (personal breakfast pet peeve), well-cooked eggs.

From the moment we walked in, the staff was kind, pleasant and accommodating. Everyone said hi to us (literally every bartender, host and server.) I had a skinny margarita that was perfection.

And then...the food.

We got the crab mango guacamole. Wasn't sure how the flavors would fly, but it was amazing. And they brought out warm chips with a sweetish chili salsa that was a perfect complement.

For dinner, we shared the carne asada tacos and the short rib. If I had to pick one, the short rib would win hands down. It fell apart with the touch of a fork, was bathed in an amazing pepper sauce, on a pillow of smooth refried beans, with pickled onions. I would get it again, in a heartbeat. Tacos were good too, but I might stray to fish or pork next time!

Dessert was phenomenal - fiancé got the sundae last time and loved it. We got the butter cake with apple butter and butter pecan ice cream (butter on butter). It was decadent and yet not over-indulgent. Happy we shared, it was the perfect end to the meal.

I don't really know how to explain Marathon Grill. Is it diner food? Is it as good as any chain like Cheesecake Factory? They've got a little bit of everything to offer and a whole lot of choices.

I started with a blueberry and honey smoothie. The waitress got confused and asked me if I wanted it non dairy. No way! I love my yogurt. The smoothie was thick and full of blueberry. It was slightly tart. It was nice.

For lunch we got the proscuitto and mozzarella and grilled herb-marinated chicken pressed sandwiches with salad. My sister asked for the salad dressing on the side. They gave her dressing on the side and they gave me no dressing at all. I stared at my lettuce and thought, ""It looks naked."" No worries, the dressing on the side was plenty for two salads. Yummy simple caesar salads.

As for the sandwiches, the proscuitto and mazzarella is really awesome. It's pressed really flat and toasty. The most amazing part of the sandwich is the fig jam. I found it interesting they also made the sandwich with sourdough bread. It's rare I see sourdough outside of San Francisco. The chicken sandwich was not as great IMO but my sister really enjoyed it. I found the goat cheese too creamy and pungent. We ended up finishing everything.

Marathon Grill is good. The restaurant is pretty dark (navy walls with paint chipping) but it gives off a relaxing vibe.

I love Gran Caffe L'Aquila and have been there a handful of times now (5-6) and it's been great every single time. 

Service is always great and they almost always have someone straight from Italy. It gives the restaurant such an authentic feel and they always do a fantastic job (Service 5/5).

I've tried about 10ish dishes (this includes sharing some dishes with my wife on some trips) and they've all been very good, if not great. I won't list them all here but there's a good chance that whatever you order is going to be up to your expectations. I will say their menu is a bit heavy. It's a few pages long (big pages) with smallish font. It can be a little overwhelming. I'm a big believer in quality over quantity...but it does seem like they have both. Also, get some gelato, you won't regret it (Food 5/5).

Drinks are as expected as they have a full selection. Obviously, their wines from Italy are plentiful (Drinks 5/5). 

Ambiance is a bit overwhelming, especially on weekend evenings as the line is typically out the door or you're standing shoulder to shoulder to someone. You almost have to fight your way to the front in order to check in as if you're making your way to the bathroom at a concert. Outside of this, the interior is nicely decorated and fits well with the theme (Ambiance 4/5).",2019-07-22 19:48:28,Gran Caffe L'Aquila,1716 Chestnut St,Philadelphia,PA,19103,39.9512789,-75.1695181,4.5,1138.0,1.0,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'WiFi': ""'free'"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': True, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': None, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True'}","Restaurants, Gelato, Coffee & Tea, Food, Italian, Bakeries","{'Monday': '7:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '7:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '7:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '7:0-22:0', 'Friday': '7:0-23:0', 'Saturday': '8:0-23:0', 'Sunday': '8:0-22:0'}"

We only had to wait 15 minutes for a table for 3 at 7pm on a Saturday, since there are three levels and lots of space.  We were tucked into a booth in the corner of the lower level - the comfy bench seating along the wall made me happy.  Despite the coziness and number of people in the place, the noise level was low - I was probably the loudest person in the room, oops.

As everyone else had said, the food is really good and fresh.  I started with a Dock Street Rye IPA which I really enjoyed, and went with the sesame-encrusted tofu for my meal.  I'm not a vegetarian and don't normally order tofu, but it sounded intriguing.  The tofu was soft and light (not chewy and tough), crusted in a crispy sesame shell.

I fell in love with this place freshman year, when I happened across in their original location on the other side of 10th St. I asked around town about a place to get some noodles and one of the bakeries pointed me to the doors of Nan Zhou.

I don't even know where to start with this place. The quality of their noodles. The richness of their broth. The value and sized of their bowls. All of it deserves an A+. Back at their old place, you could see the kitchen from most tables and it was cool to watch the cooks pull the hand-drawn noodles, seeing it for from one lump of dough to a fist full of fine noodles. 

I honestly come by myself a lot of times if I'm craving noodles, but it's a great place to bring friends. At less than $7 a bowl, it's perfect for almost any budget. There are also lots of different cuts of beef/other meats, so there's something for everyone. My personal favorites are the original beef noodle soup, beef tendon, and beef tripe. All are very different, but oh so tasty.

Can't complain about service either. Whether you order in English or Chinese, they're speedy, polite, and very knowledgable about the menu.

Advice: 
1. This is my go-to margarita place, so definitely start with one! They're all wonderful, depending on your taste, and made with a generous amount of alcohol. I've had the original one as well as the pineapple margarita and both were delicious. 
2.Share some guac with your friends! De la hoya is my favorite! So fresh, and the chips are homemade and perfectly crispy.
3. Two Words: MACHO NACHOS. These are prepared in a large, skillet-type dish, so EVERY chip is nicely covered with toppings. Great for sharing between 3 or 4 people if you're all getting entrees as well. 
4. Try the Crispy Mahi Tacos for your meal! Beautiful presentation, fresh fish, and a complementary sauce that's the perfect combination of tang and spice. 
5. If you have room, order the corn on the cob as a side. This comes covered in cheese and savory spices.

First step: Find the restaurant. It's located in an alley with a green door, and you need to knock / ring to get it because the door is often locked. Good luck!

Step 2: Choose spicy or not spicy. That's pretty much your only decision for the night. This is a 6(-ish)-course meal, and it's all set except for the spicy/not spicy question. The food is fantastic, and I love coming here and not having to make decisions, but it also means that you probably don't want to come here very often (you may get tired of the same food). Great for special occasions, though, especially as it is a pretty unique cuisine.

Step 3: Enjoy! Once you make that decision, enjoy sitting around the table as the waiter brings dish after dish to your table.

Our server enthusiastically recommended the $55 chef's tasting, which includes 6 courses and dessert. That he was so excited about the food told me immediately that this was going to be a memorable meal.

Each course was enough for a taste, and ranged from a plate of nigiri to a savory egg custard. Everything was delicious. The standout for me was the marinated black cod served with pickled vegetables and endive.

There was a time when one would've embarked on an lengthy quest for a BBQ joint in NY/NJ/PA. Now, Sweet Lucy's is the 5th or 6th dedicated smokehouse I've discovered in Philadelphia alone.

While I won't go as far to say that it competes with the top notch cue I've enjoyed in North Carolina or Texas, Lucy's provides excellent selection, a cool vibe, and incredible value. 

After standing in a ten minute line (a good sign), I ordered a triple meat platter: pulled pork, sliced brisket, and baby back ribs. It came with a hunk of piping hot cornbread and three (!) sides. Though all looked appealing on the chalked big board menu, I ultimately settled on the baked beans, creamed spinach, and of course, the mac/cheese.

Everything on my (overloaded) tray was great. If I had to pick my favs, I'd say the creamed spinach and the ribs. You can see the smoke rings on the ribs, visible evidence they were cooked low and slow in the smoker. And damn, they tasted good.

I had the hummus with matbucha and my husband had the hummus with lamb.  We both agreed that mine was the better order, but the lamb was very good also.  I look forward to returning and trying the other options, namely the corn and the eggplant.

Initially I was disappointed that the pita was not the same as the pita from zahav, but after a few bites, I realized that this pita was even better.  It is so good! and so fresh.

I don't normally find myself focused on lunch prices. But I did think that a lunch for two here was on the pricey side.  In addition to our meals, we each got a soda and the total was over $25, plus a few bucks for tip, we were at nearly $30 for lunch.  Felt a little high to me.

Originally, we ordered a sweet white wine, that our kind, knowledgable waitress let us taste first.  We found it to be too floral for our liking, on this particular evening.  We ultimately decided on French 75's.  My boyfriend never tasted a French 75.  The drinks were spot ON.  Loved the addition of lemon rind to our fabulous potable. They were strong, but expertly crafted and balanced.

The food...
Unfortunately no cheese for me again:(.  But, we were given an extremely sincere apology by the manager.  Shortly thereafter, we were given complimentary spring pea soup with a touch of chili oil.  That soup is phenomenal!  We are late diners, so I highly suggest arriving earlier if you want to try their highly desirable mozzarella.

We decided to do small plates.  We ordered the ginger rice with poached egg, pea toast w/ bacon, grilled heart of romaine with fig, potato ravioli with lamb, and potatoes with peppers.  Everything was cooked to perfection, and came out in proper sequence in a timely fashion.

Kabira was our server, and she was energetic, very friendly, and made great recommendations from their wine list as well as the menu. I don't recall the red that she recommended, but it was delicious. 

We ordered the ham & manchego croquettes, rapini, Brussel sprouts, asparagus, shishito peppers, the whipped sheep's cheese, drunken goat cheese, patatas bravas, and bacon wrapped dates.

The surprise was a success and the party was exactly what I had envisioned. From delicious bites to a fountain pouring old fashioneds, our guests had a great time and my husband rang in his birthday surrounded by his closest friends and family.

I can't recommend Pub & Kitchen enough for a meal or special event. Their private room holds up to 50 comfortably standing, but they can also do smaller, seated groups as well.

The collard greens and green beans are the size of a 1 liter bottle of water, they won't fees a family of 6 either.

I never had any issue with the size of the side items before.

The rats incident might be caused by the construction going on down the street or maybe sabotage from nearby breakfast/lunch places that lost business after the invasion of Green Eggs or they are just plain old dirty. There's no way to know but with food like that, it's hardly a deterrent to not go. 

Since Green Eggs opened in the Gayborhood, they have took over space from Nest and expended. Business must have been good. One good thing about the rat incident is that now there's hardly a line up front. You can just go in and enjoy. Maybe another incident will even bring the price down but I'm not going to wish that to happen. 

They always have very elaborately extravagant French Toast specials, I had the Peach Cobbler French Toast the other day with brown sugar toppings that makes me feel guilty after eating.

Yes, it is expensive, and you don't get a lot, but go with a few people and split an order at least.  You'll thank everyone.  Everyone.   

The country bread with tomato is a simple, basque dish that tastes more complex than it's simple presentation and title would lead you to think possible.  I could eat this for every meal.

The spanish breakfast bite is a bit of duck sausage with fried quail egg.  Very tasty, well thought out flavors.

The Medjool dates were also terrific.  The dates pair with the bacon perfectly (everything does) the cheese and apple are also nice touches. 

I would recommend getting the vegetable board.  Lots of variety for a group.  

The papa frita were good.  Crispy potatoes served with a mild vinegar hot sauce.  It was good, but I wish they had patatas bravas on the menu instead.

The last dish that I tried was the mushroom coca, a flatbread.  It wasn't over powered with mushroom, a nice balance of earthy mushroom and cheese. 

I tried a couple of cocktails: El Alhambra and the Lincoln Club Cup.  Both were good.  The Alhambra was a twist on a gin and tonic, with rosemary, ginger, and grapefruit.  The Lincoln Club Cup was a champagne cocktail.  While both cocktails were good, nothing beats Spanish wine.  That's what I'll be sticking to next time. 

Bartenders were very friendly, and offered excellent recommendations.

I came here on a Monday night at 9PM for a table of two. We made the reservation a few weeks prior, and the 9PM slot was one of very few reservations left. We were seated promptly, and our server was attentive and knowledgable. We started off with a few drinks -- the cocktails are good, but pricey. I'd probably go with a glass of wine or a beer next time, and save the cocktails for a bar or speakeasy.

The dinner menu is broken down into three parts - the bar, grill, and dirt list. Think of 'bar' items as appetizers, the grill as main dishes, and the dirt list as sides. Going with what our server recommended (3-4 dishes per person), we ordered two apps, two mains, and two dirt list items to share.

The highlights: First, the rutabaga fondue (a MUST get); it tastes similar to a cheese fondue, but the charred onion on top turns it into a thick and savory french onion soup. Paired with the pretzel (firm and crispy on the outside, soft and chewy inside), this was definitely one of the best dishes of the night. Second, the spicy tofu. Similar to a perfectly grilled and marbled steak, the tofu was tender and cut like butter. That's how good it was! Dip a slice into the roasted miso and edamame puree, and your tongue will thank you. (The seitan was a little too charred and stringy for me, but both mains were flavorful.) Third, the broccolini rabe. I found the rabe to be better than the brussels sprouts. Served with some pickled turnip and sitting atop a thick tahini sauce, the broccolini offered a nice respite from some of the heavier dishes, including the roasted, and consequently rather oily, shaved sprouts. We finished off dinner with dessert, the chocolate bar. This was more like a fudge bar, and it was served alongside a large scoop of potent lavender ice cream. Yum!

One caveat about Vedge - their dishes seem to be geared towards people who prefer the taste of non-vegan foods but are interested in venturing into the vegan and vegetarian domains. Beware if you dislike the taste of meat, as some of Vedge's dishes may be off-putting!

Tl;dr -- Rutabaga and spicy tofu dishes are standouts at this top-notch vegan restaurant.

And my expectations were definitely high, especially seeing the amazing results of Chef Michael Solomonov's golden touch at Zahav, Federal Donuts, etc.

In short, Abe Fisher is all about contemporary twists on Jewish food -- in other words, old-school flavors but prepared *nothing* like how mama used to make it.  And that's a wonderful thing, because it's so much better.

I dropped by Abe Fisher on a Friday night without reservations.  I was expecting the dining room to be slammed and having to sit at the bar, but the reality was precisely the opposite.  A large party of pretty twentysomethings were socializing and slamming drinks at the bar, but the dining room was wide open, so I was able to snag a cozy two-top in the corner.

I started with a cocktail -- the Cherry Orchard (vodka, maraschino and sour cherries, lime, and orange bitters) -- which was strong and fabulous.  

The server also brought out two different amuse bouches.  One was in the form of small bites of wonderfully buttery and decadent sesame seed pastries -- possibly a twist on halvah.  The second was gravlax on a latke, which was one of my favorite bites of the night.  (Honestly, just feed me fresh lox and crispy latkes and I'll love you forever.)

The menu mostly consists of tapas/small plates served at various price points, but the easiest and recommended option is the four-course prix fixe ($39), which is just the right amount of food for a hungry (but not ravenous) person.  Here's the rundown of what I tasted:

#1 -- Borscht tartare with trout caviar, hard-boiled egg, and potato chips.  
#2 -- Stuffed cabbage with beef, tomato, and boursin.
#3 -- Stuffed trout ""gelfite fish"" with carrot/raisin salad and carrot puree.
#4 -- Almond panna cotta with sour cherry soup, lemon curd, meringues, and gooseberries.

The flavors and presentation of all of these items were outstanding.  In fact, having Jewish food this gourmet might just ruin you forever.  If I had to pick a highlight, it would probably be the gefilte fish.  The fish was cooked exquisitely, but what really bowled me over was the carrot puree mixed with the carrot/raisin salad.  It was vaguely reminiscent of tzimmes, but amped up a thousand times.

Abe Fisher has an impressive selection of amaro to enjoy as after-dinner digestifs.  I'm no expert on amaro, but a small glass of sweet but exhilarating S. Maria al Monte amaro was just what the doctored ordered after a hearty dinner.

Service at Abe Fisher is outstanding.  The servers were very kind and gracious, and were eager to know exactly what I thought about the various courses.  A special shout-out to Eilon, the general manager, who went above-and-beyond to ensure that I was comfortable and well taken care of.

All in all, my experience at Abe Fisher was brilliant.

With such an amazing ambiance, such a beautiful view, and  premium pricing, I had very high expectations.  On a Saturday night (busiest night of the week) we ordered lobster mac&cheese and lobster bisque soup to start. To our surprise, they said they are out of lobster. What???? So i ordered mac&cheese (no lobster) and a chilled sea food platter. My girl ordered pork dish.
The sea food combo consisted of scallops which tasted like a seafood salad at a super market, seasoned shrimp which were just ok, a few oysters were pretty good, chilled salmon which wasnt very good (also tasted like a super market seafood salad). This dish was very unimpressive for a cost of $45.  My girl's pork dish didnt taste good and was way too salty. 
Our drinks were both pretty good. Glad we had something positive. 
My conclusion here is restaurant that would be fun for happy hour for drinks and an amazing view.  The entrées were definitely not worth it and for a place this fancy it was disappointing. If this restaurant was on the first floor like any other fancy steak house or sea food place, it wouldnt survive very long.

I was here for a few hours, decided I should bring something home to go. I had a train about 20 minutes later. No problem, right? So I order something that takes normally about 10 minutes. 

I order it. Wait. Drink with friends. Say goodbye. 15 minutes pass. I go to the bartender I placed my order with. He says he'll check up on it and I follow him. He says ""It'll be right out"".

There is a window where we can see what the chefs are doing. I mention to this chef ""Is that the Margherita to go?"" ""I'm working on it!"" he replies with attitude as he goes to slowly (AND I MEAN SLOWLY) peel prosciutto from the wax paper. Oops, drops one. Ooops, drops two. Still takes his time

""I'll take it without the basil leaves""

""Ugh, fine""

He walks to the back of the kitchen. A couple minutes pass. Train leaves in about 2 minutes. I can still make it if he wraps it up.

He brings forward a bag of arugula and begins making a salad. ""I'll take it as is!"" I insist and he finally (and at a pace that would bore a sloth) boxes it up. I miss my train. Thanks asshole.

1. He knew I was in a rush. 
2. He had the pizza ready to go immediately (without basil)
3. He takes his time, with a paying customer waiting on him, getting a completely different (second order) ready to go
4. Gives a shitload of attitude

If you see the pizza chef with finger tribal tattoos and attitude, beware. That guy is a fucking asshole. If I see him again, I'm walking right out with two choice fingers towards him.

And their seasonal salads are always creative and innovative. It's also a great spot to visit in the winter to warm up with a cocktail by the fire in the cozy lounge/bar area.

They charge a premium for the benefit of providing locally grown produce and meats, and high-quality cooking to their customers. Like La Terrace next door, their menu isn't the cheapest around, but their food isn't bad.

Service has always been fine. At the bar I've been helped by Nancy, and in the dining room, Elizabeth served us. Elizabeth taught me a secret handshake which was hilarious!

This is a good after hours spot (love the relaxed ambiance) and their kitchen opens late. I've stopped in many times to munch on buffalo wings (not bad, not notable either) and fish and chips. There is ample seating; I have sat in the front, which often gets crowded, and in the rear dining room since our party was large.

Happy to improve the previous rating I gave Harp & Crown since they first opened. 
We were four last night looking for a bite to eat and some fancy cocktails.

We told them we had a reservation and yet, about 5 minutes after we were seated, I received an email stating that my reservation had been canceled. 

The hostess was new and obviously did not think to ask if my mother, who was holding on to someone to walk from the moment we entered, could walk up a ton of stairs. I asked for a table that did not involve stairs and this completely flustered the hostess. The Red Owl is in a hotel so there are elevators, by the way. The hostess tried to seat us by the bar and it was so loud, even though the place was mostly empty, that my father asked about the elevators and if seating upstairs would be quieter. The hostess again became flustered and said it would be less noisy but she wasn't sure how to get upstairs. She then spent 5 minutes with us trailing behind her back and forth to get us to the elevator. I felt awkward and embarrassed for her and already wanted to leave. 

Upstairs was not quieter.  And they tried to sit us in a booth that was made for people smaller than average. I am not small, nor is my father, so I am not sure how they thought we were going to fit there. So we moved to a table. And then the service began.

Our waiter seemed annoyed with us, except for with my fiancé. Who wasn't paying. Is that snobby? Probably but it seemed like the waiter was being extra nice to my fiancé and ignored the rest of us. He spilled hot coffee on my father and did not even notice and then was sarcastically apologetic. He did get us a napkin with club soda on it, which was very nice.

The food was fine. But nothing to write home about. And the coffee was an atrocity.

The good stuff:

- Korean Spare Robs: Delicious, absolutely delicious. We ended up getting two plates. 

- Salmon Habanero roll: Surprisingly good. The mango adds a nice sweet flavor. I would actually come back for this. 

The bad stuff:

- Cucumber roll: I'm usually not a harsh critic but this roll just tasted bad. The cucumber didn't go well with the extremely fishy crab. I've had cucumber rolls in other restaurants but this was just bad. Maybe we had a bad batch but I would never get this again. 

- Penn roll: It was ok but not something I would get again. I liked the extra texture from the tempura flakes. 

- Spicy Tuna Crispy Rice: Good idea but bad execution. It was just too crispy. It was hard to even bite through the roll so you end up trying to crunch through everything with your molars.

Family run Greek in Fairmount with exceptional creamy taramasalata the high point of the menu.  With the amount of Greek spoken by what appears to be at least three generations of the family that runs it, one would expect if not great at least very good food for the genre. Alas, the chicken kebob, a generous portion that was tasteless, overcooked rice, grilled octopus with pieces too small, a Greek salad with barely enough Feta and a side of veg, an overcooked mélange of tomato and green beans with far too much oregano. The single pita that was given was warm and excellent though each additional cost .75?  Other places full basket on the house.  Very casual service seems to work on a must-make-eye-contact basis with seemingly automatic points of service such as furnishing glasses for wine, offering dessert or bringing the check not happening unless an overture by the patron is made.

I also loved the crispy noodles with chicken! This dish had something (maybe egg-y) in the sauce that made it stand out from everything else + a nice variety of shrooms/veggies mixed in. Will order again!

veggie steamed buns - will skip next time (there was a pungent flavor in there that was very off-putting though the texture of the bun was nice) 

Wonton soup - this is a huge portion for what I was expecting, refreshing in comparison to the other dishes but still brightly flavored

Chili cabbage pork noodles - tasty but I could probably do without. It was overwhelmingly flavored with soy sauce and oils, just too greasy

Pretty friendly employees.  Nice, helpful.  Can't complain about them (unlike their Little Baby neighboor).

Meh, on the pizza.  I think I had ""the Jane"" The crust was nice - crispy and chewy at the same time, the cheese ratio (to sauce) was a bit cheese heavy for my personal liking.  It was really just a decent slice with a few small basil leaves tossed on top.  While I wont go out of my way to go back, I wont decline if someone else whats to go.  

While the pizza decor is cute, there is not as much of it as I thought there would be.  Dont get me wrong, there is a good amount of it, but I just expected it to be overwhelming.  Also, there was not a single story attached to the items - something that would be cool to add.

Our rain soaked crew arrived around 5:30 to a completely empty restaurant.  It wasn't until a hostess appeared that we found out they were seating everyone on the second floor.  We went upstairs and were surprised to find a fairly crowded bar and a few occupied tables.  How we didn't hear the peeps and music from the first floor, I have no idea.  We were seated at a booth that fit all six of us, and my side faced a wall that featured a gigantic chalkboard filled with beers, cocktails, the day's specials and happy hour info.

Smokin' Betty's Blonde, the house beer, was only three bucks during happy hour so most of us started with that.  I thought it was similar in taste to Magic Hat #9 and I enjoyed it a lot.  When a friend wrinkled her nose after tasting the Curious Georgia (a bellini-like concoction of white beer, peach schnapps and a ginger syrup-marinated peach slice), I gladly took it off her hands as I adore bellinis in their natural state and I enjoyed this interesting spin-off as well.  (So yes, for those of you doing the math, technically I was double fisting for a short period of time but I'm half Irish and this is widely accepted in our culture.)

Our group was going to order off the menu but when we saw the cheap eats offered as part of happy hour, we changed our minds.  I had the spicy dry rub wings which were awesome, but what made them even better was the barbecue sauce I requested on the side for dipping.  Sweet but with a definite zip, it was one saucy sauce!  The onion rings and corn bread we ordered for sides were pretty standard.  A friend ordered the bbq sliders and I had major food envy.  I will definitely hit those up on my next visit, with an extra side of that sauce, of course!

BEER:
Victory Summer Love - Though it wasn't the coldest of drafts, the pale ale had a nice, refreshing flavor. 

FOOD:
Sheeps Milk Ricotta - My favorite app was still as delish as before.  Mind you, I'm not a fan of the lumpy and grainy cows milk version, but the sheeps do a better job at this.  It's totally smooth and creamy like sour cream, and with the added herbs and pool of vincotta (an Italian condiment that tastes almost like balsamic vinegar) in the middle of the glob, spreading it over the grilled bread makes you smile and your tummy happy.  

Caciocavallo Stuffed Meatballs - My, oh my, can we add a 6th star to this place?  The only downfall of this dish is that there are only 2 on the plate.  The meatballs are a mixture of ground short rib & pork, and stuffed with some kind of cheese, possibly gruyère, then topped with tomato sauce and melted cheese.  The meatball texture was perfect, moist yet firm with a nice exterior crunch.  The flavors were ahh-mazing!?  Highly recommended and dish to person ratio is definitely 1:1!

Spring Pea and Mushroom Arancini - Arancini are bread crumb-coated, deep fried rice balls that are stuffed with a mixture of fillers.  Here, they add in peas and mushrooms.  The flavors were nice and subtle, but doesn't compare to the meatballs.  

Mediterranean Olives - A bowl full of green and kalamata olives were done in the traditional style but with a twist of added sliced almonds & fried rosemary.  Nice starter. 

Moroccan Mussels - The mollusks were cooked perfect and done in a mild sauce of tomatoes and herbs.  Good but nothing outstanding.

Had two draft beers as we chatted with some native Pittsburghers and then to a local attorney beside us who let us sample her Chimay blue label.  Mmmmmm, yes please. Took a gander at the Beer Bible.  Wow that's long!

It's fairly large, with what seemed like about 75 or 100 seats, or so, no counting the al fresco seating which is another 20 or so.   Most of their options are spicy, so if you're not a fan of spicy Szechuan, this may not be the pace for you, though they do have options for the spice-averse among us...myself included.  I opted for their Hot Pot, which is similar to a Japanese Shabu Shabu or a fondue.  They have an interesting take on this, as you choose your broth (pork, chicken, veggie, or spicy chili) along with as many of about 30 veggie and protein options as you like.  For proteins they had pork, beef, lamb, fish, lobster (fake) balls, fish balls, ""luncheon"" meat (spam), as well as some items that had a surcharge like clams, oysters, head-on shrimp, and lobster.  They had several kinds of tofu, as well as napa cabbage, soy bean sprouts, spinach, mushrooms, etc., and three kinds of noodles:  vermicelli, udon, and a ramen/soba hybrid.  You can choose two kinds of broth if you like, but I opted for the basic chicken.  I ordered a chrysanthemum strawberry tea, which came iced, and was great if not just a bit on the sweet side.  

They brought a butane burner to the table, atop which was placed the simmering broth.  The chicken broth was simmering with some green onions, mushrooms, tomato, and goji berries.  They also bring three dipping sauces:  peanut (savory), barbecue (savory), and a garlic oil.  I got some chili oil on the side, as well.  

The proteins and veggies arrive on a large plate, the noodles on another, and you place the raw food in the simmering broth to your desired level of doneness.  They provide a small spider with which you retrieve the items once they're cooked to your liking.  It's nice, because you can cook everything just until it's done, then pull it out.  I especially liked the fact that the noodles came dry, so when you cooked them for six or seven minutes, they came out of the broth infused with the stock...very tasty. Overall, it's a fun dinner option and great for a group of people to dine together and try new foods.  

For dessert, I opted for an unusual dish called sesame dough soup.  It was, quite possibly, the strangest thing I've ever eaten...not so much for the ingredients, but more the presentation and taste.  The ""soup"" is a very watery base with very little taste, seemingly flavored with goji berries and I'm not sure what else.  The dough balls are glutinous rice balls stuffed with a black sesame paste.  The taste was ok, however as you eat the dish, especially if you cut the balls in half in the soup, it literally looks as if someone dumped an ashtray into the soup bowl; the sesame paste looks exactly as you'd think cigarette ashes would look if dumped in a bowl of water.  A very interesting dish that was visually horrible; the taste was not enough to my liking that I'd try it again, though it's a great dish to try with a bunch of people to see their reactions.  

I can't comment on the prepared dishes, since I only had the hot pot, but from what I could see, people seemed to be enjoying their dinners.  I'd definitely go back and try some other dishes, and I'd definitely re-visit for the hot pot.

I will admit that I have a slightly skewed view on what makes a dining experience a pleasant one.  For instance, I believe that value is a integral part of a meal not in that cheaper is better but I don't really feel ripped off after eating a meal.  Also, service is not how much many times the server comes to your table but how they carry themselves when they do. 

In my mind, it's not important that a place looks nice or like a dump, if the food is expensive or cheap.  It's what the restaurant does with what they have that impresses me.  In that regard, this place kind of sucks.  It really feels like they are just phoning it in and charging out the ear for the privilege to eat there.

You see, on paper, Village Whiskey seems like an awesome situation but then they blow it with a supreme lack of value, courtesy and situation that really makes the food less palatable.

First of all, let's discuss the manner at which you can even get in the door.  You can not make reservations but only put your name in, walk away and then come back when they have estimated a table will be ready.  This is a system not set up for the patron but for simplicity sake concerning the restaurant.  It also looks impressive when people are just waiting to get in.

The whole no reservation situation is really the paramount example of how this place treats the relation between the patron and the business and it rolls down from there.  Between trying to charge $24 for a hamburger to being open weird hours on Sunday, it's pretty clear that you are lucky to be able to eat here so get used to it.",2010-04-09 15:03:33,Village Whiskey,118 S 20th St,Philadelphia,PA,19103,39.9514165949,-75.1737677917,4.0,1553.0,1.0,"{'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'CoatCheck': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{u'breakfast': False, u'brunch': False, u'lunch': None, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': None, u'dessert': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'DriveThru': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': True, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': True, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}"", 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False'}","Bars, Nightlife, Whiskey Bars, Burgers, Restaurants, American (New)","{'Wednesday': '16:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '16:0-21:0', 'Friday': '16:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-21:0'}"

I remember the food being very good when I went for brunch and dinner didn't disappoint either. I dined on the fried green tomato BLT and loved the play on what could be considered a boring sammich. I LOVE fried green tomatoes and they definitely hit the spot. Really liked the goat cheese as well. And I'm pretty sure they put crack on their fries because they were amazing and I couldn't stop eating them. 

The layout of the place is a little weird. Kitchen is on the first floor and bar is on the second floor. I didn't even realize this until I kept seeing our server go up and down the stairs. Bathrooms are in the basement, and are set up in quirky fashion which I liked. Reminded me of Tattooed Mom's on South Street.

We were a group of 7 there on a Tuesday night, when the place was pretty empty. Our server, off the bat, told us how she was frustrated that the manager had cut the rest of the staff loose so she was running everything alone. While I feel for her (used to be a server), there's no need to tell the patrons about that multiple times. Just say you're a bit short staffed and leave it at that. She basically told us that everything had to come out at once (we wanted apps, then entrees) because she was working alone. 

The beers were good. That is truly the only redeeming quality here. They have an awesome beer selection so if you're just looking to drink - go for it. 

Now- the food- yikes. First off, I never got my entree, so I can't comment on what it was. It literally never came, the server never came to check that we had gotten our orders, so I had to go get pizza after this ""dinner."" I did get my buffalo shrimp appetizer, which was seriously appalling. It was 7 little shrimp with tails on smothered in buffalo sauce with two large ""blue cheese fritters"" next to it. Those fritters were completely raw balls of dough- disgusting. When I told the server about it, she begrudgingly took them back to be recooked after exclaiming ""well I don't cook them so I don't know."" They came back out burnt on the outside, still raw on the inside, and with a molten blue cheese center. They were inedible, and I still had to pay $12 for that. 

Everyone else's meals were just blah. Side salads are just a handful of leaves smothered in dressing (not even a tomato or a crouton, seriously?), burgers were mostly undercooked.

Note - you do have the option on the ordering tablet of building your own salad or stir fry by choosing all the ingredients ... but sometimes I don't feel like making any more decisions in life!",2019-08-06 18:40:12,honeygrow,110 S 16th St,Philadelphia,PA,19102,39.9507231094,-75.1675008738,3.5,560.0,1.0,"{'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""u'none'"", 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'Caters': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': None, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsTableService': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': None, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'BYOB': 'False', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'Corkage': 'False'}","Salad, Restaurants, Noodles, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Vegetarian, Food, Fruits & Veggies, Specialty Food, Vegan","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '10:30-22:0', 'Wednesday': '10:30-22:0', 'Thursday': '10:30-22:0', 'Friday': '10:30-22:0', 'Saturday': '10:30-22:0', 'Sunday': '10:30-22:0'}"

I came here on a Sunday with a group of people and we waited ~30min or less but I saw the line just growing longer as time went on. We came around ~11:30am. Get there early Sunday to get a table otherwise there's usually an hour wait usually.

I got the Parsian Zá ($17)- Open-face croissant topped with goat cheese wrapped in ham and sprinkled with some avocado and caramelized onions. Served with two eggs (your choice of style). It also comes with a side of potatoes and mini salad. The eggs were average but the French ham with goat cheese inside tastes really good!!! Excellent combination of flavors!!! I really liked this dish. Everyone else I was with loved their dishes too. I tried a bite of the steak and it was super juicy and flavorful as well. It's a decent amount and I was pretty full when I left. 

I really like their French Lebanese brunch concept. The presentation for all the dishes were really nice and the food quality is really good!! 

I also got Pomegranate Juice- Fresh!!!!!! This was really good!!!!! On the sweeter side just fyi but SO SO GOOD. They also put it into a to-go cup if you can't finish it....I thought this was really nice. For $3.25 you get a decent amount of juice! If they sold this juice separately in gallons I'd buy it!!

TLDR: Great brunch place in Philly!

there's no other restaurant in philly where i've tried 90% of their menu - and every single dish has been a winner. some of our favorites include...

chicken in garlic sauce -- always included in our order and definitely a crowd pleaser. i love the mountain of bamboo shoots it comes with and it's one of the more milder dishes on the menu in terms of spice.

eggplant in garlic sauce -- i'm a huge fan of the eggplant alternative of the above dish, which tastes amazing when you mash the tender eggplant in with your white rice. very leftover friendly.

fish in hot sauce -- i don't order fish often as an entree but this is probably my top pick at han dynasty. the fish is boneless and tossed in some kind of batter that just soaks up the hot sauce it comes swimming in.

beef with scallions -- one of my bf's favorites. it's not a spicy dish at all, but super flavorful.

lamb dry pot -- we usually order this when we're trying to stir up our usual order a bit or if we're introducing somebody to han for the first time. it comes out so fancy in its little silver pot! the lamb is tender and not gamy at all.

dan dan noodles -- a must! the nutty, savory flavor of the sesame really shines with these noodles. 

wontons in chili oil -- this dish will numb your tongue. the wontons are on point, but i can usually only eat one or two per meal.

beef fried rice -- a perennial item on most chinese menus, and a great option for people who are more apprehensive about the spice at han dynasty.",2016-07-31 23:21:46,Han Dynasty,123 Chestnut St,Philadelphia,PA,19106,39.9485257778,-75.143727802,4.0,1474.0,1.0,"{'HasTV': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'"", 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'None', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'CoatCheck': 'False'}","Beer, Wine & Spirits, Chinese, Restaurants, Food, Szechuan, Noodles, Soup","{'Monday': '16:0-21:30', 'Tuesday': '15:0-21:30', 'Wednesday': '15:0-21:30', 'Thursday': '13:0-21:30', 'Friday': '12:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-21:30'}"
